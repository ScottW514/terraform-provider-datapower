name: AssemblyActionLog
description: The log assembly action writes transaction data to the <tt>log</tt> variable
  and can send the data to the analytics server. At the end of the transaction, the
  API gateway updates the log according to the content type that is specified in the
  last log action in the assembly. When the content type is not specified in the log
  action, the API gateway uses the content type specified in the API definition. <p>This
  action is not supported in IBM Cloud. Any assembly that includes it will fail.</p>

  description: Specify the path that correlates the API action to a specific part
    of the API specification. The correlation path specifies the part of the API definition
    that correlates with the API action. This path is exposed in the debug data by
    the API gateway for use by debugging tools. For example, for an API configuration
    that is retrieved from API Connect and specified in an OpenAPI document with IBM
    extensions, this path is the JSON path to the assembly policy in the IBM extensions
    section of the document. The path can be expressed in any form that the debugging
    tool can correlate to the API definition.
