  description: <p>When balancing with Weighted Round Robin, the weight property indicates
    the relative priority of this server versus the other members of the group. The
    greater the weight indicates the higher the preference. Use an integer between
    1 and 65000.</p><p>For example, assume three server pool members, A, B, and C,
    with assigned weights of 5, 3, and 2 respectively. As a result of this weighting,
    server A can expect to receive approximately 50% of client requests, server B
    can expect to receive approximately 30% of client requests, with server C receiving
    the remaining 20%.</p>

  description: <p>Specifies the port on the real server. If non-zero, the associated
    real server is contacted on this port. Normally the real server is contacted on
    the same port number as that of the virtual server and this should not be set
    to a value other than zero. However, if you have services that run on different
    ports for different members of the group, you might need to define this value.</p><p>The
    DataPower Gateway checks this port when the health check type is IMS Connect.</p>
