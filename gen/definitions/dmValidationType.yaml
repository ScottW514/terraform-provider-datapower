  type: Bool

  description: This property allows the value to be checked for Cross Site Scripting
    (XSS) signatures. These signatures are malicious attempts to input client-side
    script as the input to a web application. If this client-side script is later
    displayed in a browser, the script executes and can perform malicious activities.
    Enable this feature to filter input for malicious content that might get stored
    and displayed again later, such as the contents of a comment form. The check looks
    for invalid characters and various forms of the term &lt;script that is often
    used to engage JavaScript on a browser without the user knowing.

    to be used by the XSS filter.
