name: HTTPInputConversionMap
description: This defines the rules for handling HTTP to XML conversion of form values
  in an HTTP GET or POST of a form. There are different conversion (Encoding) rules
  for the values. They control how the value is mapped to the contents of its &lt;arg>
  element in the resulting XML. There is a default Encoding, which is all that is
  required. There can also be specific Encodings applied to values based on the name
  associated with a value, which is done using an ordered list of PCREs.

  description: This allows selecting the Encoding for values based on their name.
    The names are matched by PCREs. Each PCRE is associated with an Encoding that
    controls how the value is mapped to the contents of an &lt;arg> element in the
    resulting XML. This is an ordered list, comparision of the name proceeds until
    the first match. If there is no match, the Encoding will be selected by the Default
    Encoding of this HTTP Input Conversion Map.
