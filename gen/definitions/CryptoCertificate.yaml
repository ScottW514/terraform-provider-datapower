  description: Specify whether to ignore the expiration date of the certificate. When
    enabled, the certificate remains in the <tt>up</tt> operational state outside
    of its expiration values. <p>Although the certificate is in the <tt>up</tt> state,
    other configurations that reference the certificate use the internal expiration
    values. In other words, the certificate itself is in the <tt>up</tt> state, but
    any configuration that references the certificate adheres to the internal expiration
    values.</p><ul><li>If the certificate is for certificate chain validation in validation
    credentials and the certificate is invalid, validation fails. Expired certificates
    cause the validation to fail unless you disable check dates in validation credentials.</li><li>If
    the certificate is in identification credentials, the DataPower Gateway sends
    the certificate to the peer. The peer can reject the certificate as invalid.</li></ul>
