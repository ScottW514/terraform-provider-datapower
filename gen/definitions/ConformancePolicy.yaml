  description: Requirements that should not be validated. A requirement is specified
    by a string of the form "&lt;profile>:&lt;reqid>", where &lt;profile> names the
    profile and is one of BP1.0, BP1.1, BSP1.0 or AP1.0, and &lt;reqid> names the
    requirement within that profile, and follows the naming convention used by the
    profile itself. For example, requirement R4221 in the Basic Security Profile 1.0
    would be named as "BSP1.0:R4221".

    message, possibly modified by one or more stylesheets, to the next multistep stage.
    Setting this property will instead cause the analysis result to be used as the
    output. This is primarily intended for use within a loopback firewall, which will
    return the analysis results to the client.

- name: ResponsePropertiesEnabled
  type: Bool
  default: false
  description: When placed inside a single conformance check action (as is typical
    in an XML gateway), a single set of logging and behavior parameters is sufficent.
    However, sometimes (as in the case of auto-generated WS-Proxy conformance checking),
    the same policy is used in checks in both the request and response directions.
    In this case, the conformance reports should likely be sent to different targets.
    This toggle allows for an alternate set of logging and rejection parameters to
    be specified for messages in the response direction.
