  type: String
  description: Specify the path that correlates the API action to a specific part
    of the API specification. The correlation path specifies the part of the API definition
    that correlates with the API action. This path is exposed in the debug data by
    the API gateway for use by debugging tools. For example, for an API configuration
    that is retrieved from API Connect and specified in an OpenAPI document with IBM
    extensions, this path is the JSON path to the assembly policy in the IBM extensions
    section of the document. The path can be expressed in any form that the debugging
    tool can correlate to the API definition.
