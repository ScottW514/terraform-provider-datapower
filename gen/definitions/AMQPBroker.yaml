name: AMQPBroker
description: In AMQP, distributed source and target termini are managed by a broker.
  The broker provides messaging services for communicating applications by periodically
  monitoring and polling termini. The broker ensures that sent messages are directed
  to the correct target terminus or are routed to another server. The AMQP broker
  configuration corresponds to an AMQP broker that is running on another host in the
  network. The configured properties enable communication between the DataPower Gateway
  and the remote AMQP broker.
