name: MTOMPolicy
description: An MTOM policy provides a mechanism for optimizing the transmission and
  wire format of an XML/SOAP message. Optimization is performed by selecting elements
  with base64-encoded character data. The selected elements are decoded and attached
  as MIME attachment parts before transmission. Decoding before transmission reduces
  the overhead that is associated with base64-encoded data.

  enum:
  - encode

  default: encode
  description: Specify the optimization mode. <p>The encode option optimizes (serializes)
    input messages. For serialization, provide an XPath expression or a list of XPath
    expressions to identify the content to extract. Optionally, per XPath expression,
    exercise control over the Content Type and Content ID values. These two values
    can be determined automatically using the xmlmime:contentType declaration and
    namespace declaration.</p><p>The decode option decodes (deserializes) attachment
    parts of an optimized message. Deserialization, by default, reassembles the original
    infoset, which results in either a SOAP document or MIME document depending on
    whether all attachments were referenced by &lt;Include/> elements. Optionally,
    you can specify a Content ID to select individual attachment parts to reassemble.</p>
