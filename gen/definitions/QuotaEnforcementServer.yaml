description: '<p>On each DataPower Gateway, you configure the quota enforcement server
  to store the thresholds and associated metadata in memory or persist them on the
  RAID volume.</p><p>The quota enforcement server can work in standalone mode or peer
  group mode.</p><p>A peer group is collection of at least three nodes across which
  quota enforcement is implemented. In each peer group, one DataPower Gateway is the
  primary node and others are replicas. Failover might occur when the primary node
  becomes unavailable.</p><p>When you enable the peer group mode, the appropriate
  configuration properties are displayed. You must configure the connection among
  peers.</p><p>Based on your requirements for quota enforcement, you can enable or
  disable strict mode. Strict mode affects data-consistency across the peer group.</p><p>When
  strict mode is enabled, the following effects are caused: <ul><li>When the primary
  node is operational and when strict mode of all nodes in a peer group is enabled,
  threshold synchronization is more frequent to ensure data-consistency across the
  peer group. However, more network bandwidth is used. Therefore, strict mode is suitable
  for peers in the same data center.</li><li>When the primary node becomes unavailable,
  before failover occurs, the replica with enabled strict mode cannot process the
  request. <p>If service performance and availability are more important than data-consistency,
  you can disable strict mode for the replica so that this replica can process the
  request. The replica with disabled strict mode writes the threshold and associated
  metadata to the local data storage. After failover occurs, the connection is resumed
  between the replica and the new primary node. The threshold and associated metadata
  stored by the replica might be overwritten by the new primary node when the new
  primay node synchronizes the data to all replicas. Data-consistency might be affected
  across the peer group.</p></li></ul></p><p>By default, data is stored in memory
  and quota enforcement server works in standalone mode.</p>'
