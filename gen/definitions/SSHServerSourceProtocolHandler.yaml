name: SSHServerSourceProtocolHandler
description: <p>The SFTP server handler provides an SSH SFTP server that can be used
  to submit files for processing by the system. Each file that is written results
  in one transaction.</p><p>There can be multiple SFTP servers, but only one server
  can be configured to listen on the default SSH port 22 on a given interface. There
  can be multiple simultaneous connections from SFTP clients to the same SFTP server.</p><p><b>Note:</b>
  Changes in the configuration affect only new connections to this SFTP server. Existing
  connections continue to use their current configuration until they disconnect.</p>

    port is the port on which SFTP connections can be established. This port does
    not control the TCP port that is used for the data connections. Enter a value

    access to the SFTP server based on the IP address of the SFTP client. When attached
    to a server, the default for an ACL is to deny all access. To deny access to only
    select IP addresses, first grant access to all addresses (allow 0.0.0.0). Then,
    create deny entries for the desired hosts.</p><p>If an ACL with the same name
    as this handler exists, the system DataPower Gateway might inadvertently use that
    ACL rather than the one specified here.</p>
