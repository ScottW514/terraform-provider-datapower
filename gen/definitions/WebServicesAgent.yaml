  required: true

  description: Specify the maximum number of transaction records to buffer. Buffering
    controls the behavior of the agent when there are no registered consumers of transaction
    events. Records are accumulated until they reach the configured threshold. After
    this threshold is reached, new records are dropped. The loss of records are visible
    to web service managers that understand the concept.

  description: Specify the maximum total payload size in KB of a buffered transaction
    record. The total payload size is the sum of the payloads that are collected at
    the following points. <ul><li>When the service accepts the request.</li><li>When
    the service sends the processed request to its target.</li><li>When the service
    accepts the response.</li><li>When the service sends the processed response to
    the client.</li></ul><p>A record is dropped when its total payload size exceeds
    the maximum value. The default value is 0, which indicates no limit.</p>
