name: DomainAvailability
description: Domain availability monitors each multiprotocol gateway and web service
  proxy in the domain. When the operational state of any service in the domain is
  in the down state, the operational state for domain availability is down to indicate
  that these services are not ready to accept traffic. At startup, domain availability
  maintains all handlers in a quiesced state until their associated services are fully
  configured. When these services are ready to accept traffic, an event is written
  to the log that indicates that the domain is ready to process traffic.
