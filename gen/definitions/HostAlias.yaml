name: HostAlias
description: A host alias is a map between a local IP address to a local alias. The
  host alias is resolved like a static host entry. Host aliases provide a level of
  abstraction between concrete network addresses and configuration. You can use host
  aliases where you can define local IP addresses. Host aliases ease the export and
  migration of service among DataPower Gateway instances. The alias is exported, but
  the alias map is not. If the alias is defined on the destination system, the alias
  resolves to the IP address that is defined on the destination system.
