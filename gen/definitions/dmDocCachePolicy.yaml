    you define multiple policies, the DataPower Gateway retains the policies in an

    the DataPower Gateway caches candidate documents for the appropriate validity
    period.</p><ul><li>Use a high priority for policies that you want to cache.</li><li>Use
    a low priority for generic policies. For example, set the priority to 1 when <tt>*</tt>
