  description: <p>Specify JMS nondefault bootstrap server endpoints by host, port,
    and protocol to use for the bootstrap process.</p><p>A service integration bus
    (SIB) supports applications that use message-based and service-oriented architectures.
    A bus is a group of interconnected servers and clusters that were added as members.
    Applications connect to a bus at one of the messaging engines that is associated
    with its bus members.</p><p>A messaging engine is a component that runs inside
    a server. The messaging engine manages messaging resources for a bus member. Applications
    connect to a messaging engine when a SIB is accessed.</p><p>Applications, such
    as the WebSphere JMS message provider, that run outside the WebSphere Application
    Server environment cannot directly locate a suitable messaging engine to connect
    to the target bus. In such cases, the remote clients or servers must access the
    bus through a bootstrap server that is a member of the target bus. A bootstrap
    server is an application server that runs the SIB process. The bootstrap server
    does not need to run any message engines. Rather the bootstrap server selects
    a messaging engine that is running in an application server that supports the
    bootstrap protocol that was requested.</p><p>The connection sequence to a messaging
    engine is as follows. <ol><li>The remote application first connects to a bootstrap
    server.</li><li>The bootstrap server selects a messaging engine.</li><li>The bootstrap
    server tells the client application to connect to that message engine to gain
    bus access.</li></ol></p><p>A bootstrap server uses a host name or IP address,
    with a port number and a bootstrap transport chain. The transport chain identifies
    the protocol stack that is offered by the bootstrap server to define an endpoint
    address.</p><p>The protocol stack that is used to access the bootstrap server
    does not need to be the same protocol stack that is used for actual message transfer
    over the bus.</p><p>You can add multiple nondefault bootstrap servers. For failover
    capability, the endpoints must be members of the same WebSphere Application Server
    cluster.</p>
