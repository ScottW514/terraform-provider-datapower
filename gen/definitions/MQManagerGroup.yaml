name: MQManagerGroup
description: <p>An IBM MQ queue manager group enables automatic failover between queue
  managers when a queue manager becomes unavailable. When you define multiple backup
  queue managers, the first active queue manager in the group replaces the primary
  queue manager.</p><p>You can configure the queue manager to work with the multi-instance
  feature in the IBM MQ server. Connect the primary queue manager to one of the instances
  of a queue manager in the IBM MQ server, and the backup queue manager to the other
  instance. All connections for the queue manager group go to the queue manager connected
  to the active instance. If the active instance in the IBM MQ server fails, the queue
  manager connected to the standby instance automatically takes over all the data
  and logs from the queue manager connected to the original active instance.</p>
