    to the WebSphere JMS or TIBCO EMS object for processing; all other messages are
    dropped from the get queue.</p><p>The message selector is a conditional expression
    based on a subset of SQL92 conditional expression syntax. The conditional expression
    enables the handler to identify <em>messages of interest</em> .</p><p>The conditional
    expression does not operate on the body of the message, rather it examines message
    headers and properties (proprietary user-created headers that might appear between
    the required headers and the message body).</p><p>The required headers are as
    follows:</p><ul><li><tt>Destination</tt> - contains the destination (queue) to
    which the message is being sent</li><li><tt>DeliveryMode</tt> - contains the delivery
    mode (PERSISTENT or NON_PERSISTENT)</li><li><tt>Expiration</tt> - contains a message
    TTL or a value of 0 indicating an unlimited TTL</li><li><tt>Priority</tt> - contains
    the message priority expressed as a digit from 0 (lowest priority) to 9 (highest
    priority)</li><li><tt>MessageID</tt> - contains a unique message identifier starting
    with the prefix ID:, or a null value, effectively disabling message ID</li><li><tt>Timestamp</tt>
    - contains the time the message was handed off for transmission, not the time
    it was actually sent</li><li><tt>CorrelationID</tt> - contains a means of associating
    one message (for example, a response) with another message (for example, the original
    request)</li><li><tt>ReplyTo</tt> - contains the destination (queue) to which
    a reply to this message should be sent</li><li><tt>Type</tt> - contains a message
    identifier provided by the application</li><li><tt>Redelivered</tt> - contains
    a boolean indicating that the message has been delivered in the past, but not
    yet acknowledged</li></ul><p>Configuration of a message selector is optional.
    If a message selector is not specified, all incoming client request messages are
    transferred by The handler to the DataPower object for processing.</p>
