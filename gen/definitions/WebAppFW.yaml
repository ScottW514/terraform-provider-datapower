- name: DoChunkedUpload
  type: Bool
  default: false
  description: Use the radio buttons to enable (on) or disable (off) the ability to
    send Content-Type Chunked Encoded documents to the back end server. When the device
    employs the HTTP/1.1 protocol, the body of the document can be delimited by either
    Content-Length or chunked encodings. While all servers will understand how to
    interpret Content-Length, many applications will fail to understand Chunked encoding.
    For this reason, Content-Length is the standard method used. However doing so
    interferes with the ability of the device to fully stream. To stream full documents
    towards the back end server, this property should be turned on. However, the back
    end server must be RFC 2616 compatible, because this feature cannot be renegotiated
    at run time, unlike all other HTTP/1.1 features which can be negotiated down at
    runtime if necessary. This property can also be enabled by configuring a User

  description: A Rewrite Policy can be used to modify the values of certain headers

    a browser directly to the back end web site, rather than through the Web Application
    Firewall.

  description: Some protocols have distinct name based elements, separate from the

    otherwise it will receive a request reflecting the information as it arrived at
    the DataPower device. Web servers issuing redirects may want to disable this feature,
    as they often depend on the host header for the value of their redirect.
