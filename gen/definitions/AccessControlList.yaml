name: AccessControlList
description: An access control list (ACL) consists of a sequence of allow and deny
  clauses. Each clause identifies an IP address or range of addresses that grants
  or denies access to a service. <p>Candidate addresses are sequentially evaluated
  against each clause. A candidate address is granted or denied access in accordance
  with the first clause that matches. Consequently, the order of the clauses is vital.</p><p>An
  ACL with only deny clauses effectively disables the service. To complete the configuration,
  include an allow clause to ensure that all addresses that are not explicitly denied
  access are granted access.</p>
