name: AssemblyActionRedact
description: The redact assembly action redacts or removes data from fields in the
  request body, in the response body, or in the activity logs. <p>This action is useful
  to remove or block out sensitive data for legal, security, or other reasons. The
  input to this action must be parsed data. One way to produce parsed data is to add
  a parse assembly action before the redact assembly action in your assembly.</p>

- name: CorrelationPath
  type: String
  description: Specify the path that correlates the API action to a specific part
    of the API specification. The correlation path specifies the part of the API definition
    that correlates with the API action. This path is exposed in the debug data by
    the API gateway for use by debugging tools. For example, for an API configuration
    that is retrieved from API Connect and specified in an OpenAPI document with IBM
    extensions, this path is the JSON path to the assembly policy in the IBM extensions
    section of the document. The path can be expressed in any form that the debugging
    tool can correlate to the API definition.
