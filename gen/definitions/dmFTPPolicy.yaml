  description: Specify the shell-style expression to define the URL set.
- name: Passive
  type: String
  enum:
  - pasv-off
  - pasv-opt
  - pasv-req
  required: true
  default: pasv-req
  description: Specify the use of FTP passive mode to control in which direction FTP
    data connections are made.

- name: UseCCC
  type: String
  enum:
  - ccc-off
  - ccc-opt
  - ccc-req
  required: true
  default: ccc-off
  description: Specify the cessation of FTP command channel encryption after user
    authentication. Encryption must be stopped for compatibility with NAT and other
    firewall applications. Although a security risk, no other option exists when NAT
    is in use.

  - enc-data-req
  required: true
  default: enc-data-off
  description: Specify the use of encryption of file transfers. Compatible with NAT
    in all settings.

  - evaluation: property-value-in-list
    attribute: AuthTLS
    value:
    - auth-off
- name: DataType
  type: String
  enum:
  - ascii
  - binary
  required: true
  default: binary
  description: Specify the default file transfer data type. In most cases, the value
    of binary is appropriate.
- name: SlashSTOU
  type: String
  enum:
  - slash-stou-off
  - slash-stou-on
  required: true
  default: slash-stou-on
  description: Specify whether to create a unique file if the name contains a trailing
    slash. Some FTP servers provide the STOU command. Use the command only if the
    FTP server supports this command. The STOU command allows the server to choose
    the unique file name in the current directory. Using the STOU command does not
    require the client to choose a unique file name. When enabled and a URL is given
    to write that ends in a /, the server uses the STOU command instead of the STOR
    command.
- name: QuotedCommands
  type: String
  reference_to: FTPQuoteCommands
  description: Specify the list of FTP commands to send to the server before each
    FTP STOR, STOU, or RETR command. Useful with "SITE" commands, such as "SITE RECFM=FB"
    for the MVS domain on a z/OS system. These commands cannot be data-transfer related,
    such as STOU, RETR, PORT, PASV, etc.
- name: SizeCheck
  type: String
  enum:
  - size-check-optional
  - size-check-disabled
  default: size-check-optional
  description: Specify whether to check the file size after file transfer. Uses the
    SIZE command, and compares the returned number to the number of bytes transferred
    "over the wire" for the file transfer. If the numbers are not equal, the file
    transfer is marked as failing. If the FTP server does not support the SIZE command,
    no error results. Some FTP servers, particularly vsftpd in the default configuration,
    provide inaccurate SIZE responses for files transferred in ASCII mode. If you
    get such errors, you can disable this feature. Alternately you can reconfigure
    vsftpd.
