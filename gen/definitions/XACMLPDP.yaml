description: The XACML policies can be evaluated on a DataPower device, This on-box
  XACML Policy Decision Point (PDP) allows customers to define the necessary information
  so that it can evaluate the corresponding XACML policies against a XACML request
  for an XACML Policy Enforcement Point (PEP). The DataPower PEP is implemented with
  AAA action.
