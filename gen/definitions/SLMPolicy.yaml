name: SLMPolicy
description: <p>An SLM policy counts messages or measures latency for messages that
  match a set of select criteria and that pass through the appliance during a configured
  interval. The policy can take action when configured thresholds are reached.</p><p>Messages
  can be selected based on credential class, resource class, or both. If neither,
  all messages are selected.</p><p>A policy consists of one or more statements. Each
  statement establishes the credential class, resource class, thresholds, and actions
  to take when thresholds are met during an interval.</p><p>Examples:</p><ul><li>A
  policy that throttles all traffic that arrives at a rate faster than 1000 messages
  per second.</li><li>A policy that generates a log message for all messages that
  arrive during the last elapsed second that originated from a specific IP address
  and requested use of a specific resource.</li></ul>
