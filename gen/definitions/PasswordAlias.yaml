name: PasswordAlias
description: The password map alias provides the mapping of an alias to a plaintext
  password. The alias is a publicly known reference that is included in configuration
  files and exports. With an alias you keep the real password secret because the plaintext
  value for the password is stored in an encrypted file. The password for the alias
  cannot be viewed or accessed by anyone. Only the system can extract the password
  that it uses internally. <p>No aliased passwords are written to configuration files.
  The mapping is not part of a backup or export operation. The mapping is part of
  the secure backup-restore operations.</p>
