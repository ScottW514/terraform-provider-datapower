name: NameValueProfile
description: Many HTTP things are expressed as name value pairs. These include HTTP
  headers, cookie values, url-encoded query strings, and url-encoded request messages.
  This profile provides a mechanism for what kinds of names are expected and for each
  kind of name what properties should be enforced on the corresponding values. When
  a name-value pair is not validated successfully that may generate an error, the
  pair might be stripped from the transaction, or the value may be mapped to another
  default value.

  description: Each pair submitted to this profile consults this validation list,
    looking for the first regular expression match of the name against the name expression
    in the list. When that is found, the corresponding value constraint is matched
    against the value portion of the name-value pair. If that does not match, the
    policy applies the 'fixup' attribute to the submitted value. That may result in
    no change, the pair being removed, an error being generated, or the value being
    mapped to a known constant.

  description: This property allows the value to be checked for Cross Site Scripting

    script as the input to a web application. If this client-side script is later
    displayed in a browser, the script executes and can perform malicious activities.
    Enable this feature to filter input for malicious content that might get stored
    and displayed again later, such as the contents of a comment form. The check looks
    for invalid characters and various forms of the term &lt;script that is often
    used to engage JavaScript on a browser without the user knowing.
