  type: String
  enum:
  - '4'

  description: Specify the preferred IP version to resolve hostnames. When a hostname
    resolves to both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, this setting determines which version
    to use.

- name: ForceIPPreference
  type: Bool
  default: false
  description: Specify whether to restrict DNS queries to the preferred IP version
    to resolve hostnames. You want to force the IP preference except when both IPv4
    and IPv6 addresses are in use. When not forced, the device resolves each hostname
    by querying A and AAAA records and waiting for both responses or a timeout. Waiting
    for the response or timeout for both records can introduce unnecessary latency
    in DNS resolution.

  description: For the first alive algorithm, specify the maximum number of resolution
    attempts to send a query to the list of name servers before an error is returned.
    By default, an unacknowledged resolution request is attempted 3 times.

  type: Int64
  default: 5
  description: For the first alive algorithm, specify the duration in seconds that
    the resolver waits for a response from a DNS server. After expiry, the resolver
    attempts the query to a different DNS server. The default value is 5.
