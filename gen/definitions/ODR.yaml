name: ODR
description: <p>Specifies an on demand router (ODR). The ODR feature acts as a collection
  of load balancer groups that distribute traffic to various clusters within a WebSphere
  cell or Liberty Collective. If multiple ODR connector groups are defined, the ODR
  distributes traffic to any of the clusters.</p><p>The ODR feature on the DataPower
  Gateway supports a subset of On Demand Router in Intelligent Management.</p>

    routing rules, and other information over the connectors in the connector group.
