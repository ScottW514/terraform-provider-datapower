description: Identification credentials consist of a key and a certificate. Identification
  credentials identify the matched public key cryptography to the public and private
  keys that an object uses for TLS authentication. You use identification credentials
  for document encryption, document decryption, and digital signature operations.

  description: Specify the list to manage intermediate certificates. Intermediate
    certificate authority (CA) certificates might be necessary when the CA that is
    signing this certificate is not widely recognized. If the intermediate CA certificate
    is also signed by a less recognized CA, another intermediate CA certificate might
    be necessary for that CA. You can specify up to 10 intermediate certificates.
    <p>If necessary, use the list of available certificate aliases to establish a
    verifiable trust chain. A trust chain consists of one or more CA certificates.
    A trust chain provides a linked path from certificates in the identification credentials
    to a CA that is trusted by a remote DataPower&#174; Gateway. The trust chain enables
    the DataPower Gateway to authenticate the certificate.</p>
