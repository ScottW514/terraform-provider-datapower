- name: ContentType
  type: String
  description: The Content Type for the extracted element data. This option overrides
    the value that is attained from the xmlmime:contentType attribute. If the provided
    XPath matches more than one element, each corresponding MIME attachment part will
    contain a content-type header with this value. If different content-type values
    are required, selective XPath expressions are required.

- name: ContentID
  type: String
  description: If not explicitly configured, content IDs are automatically generated.
    Using this property allows for the explicit configuration of content-id headers
    and their associated href values. Rules that match multiple data elements result
    in one attachment part for all matched elements. The resulting attachment part
    contains data from the last match only.
