  description: <p>Enter the PCRE to use to rename a file that is being processed.
    This functionality allows multiple pollers to poll the same directory with the
    same match pattern. There is no lack of atomicity if the rename operation on the
    server is atomic. The poller that succeeds in renaming the input file will proceed
    to process the file. Any other poller that tries to rename the file at the same
    time will fail to rename the file and will proceed to try the next file that matches
    the specified match pattern.</p><p>To ensure uniqueness, the resulting file name
    will be in the following format:</p><p><em>filename</em> . <em>hostname</em> .
    <em>serial</em> . <em>domain</em> . <em>poller</em> . <em>timestamp</em></p><p><dl><dt><em>filename</em></dt><dd>The
    file name for the renamed input file.</dd><dt><em>hostname</em></dt><dd>The hostname
    (system identifier) of the configured DataPower device.</dd><dt><em>serial</em></dt><dd>The
    serial number of the configured DataPower device.</dd><dt><em>domain</em></dt><dd>The
    domain of the polling object.</dd><dt><em>poller</em></dt><dd>The name of the
    polling object.</dd><dt><em>timestamp</em></dt><dd>The timestamp</dd></dl></p><p><b>Note:</b>
    File renaming cannot be used with an FTP server that supports only 8.3 file names.</p><p>For
    example if the input files are <tt>NNNNNN.input</tt> and you want to rename them
    to <tt>NNNNNN.processing</tt> , then the match pattern would be <tt>"([0-9]{6})\.input$"</tt>
    and the processing pattern would be <tt>"$1.processing"</tt> . The resultant file
    name on the server would be:</p><p><tt>NNNNNN.processing. <em>hostname</em> .
    <em>serial</em> . <em>domain</em> . <em>poller</em> . <em>timestamp</em></tt></p><p><b>Note:</b>
    If no processing rename pattern is configured, the file will still be renamed.
    The only difference is that the <em>filename</em> portion of the resulting file
    is the name of the original input file, not the renamed input file.</p>
