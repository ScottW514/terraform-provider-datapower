  description: The ODR connectors that are used to retrieve ODR information. An ODR
    connector defines a connection to the Intelligent Management service. The DataPower
    Gateway retrieves topology, weights, session affinity, and other information from
    the WebSphere cell over the connection. If multiple connectors are configured,
    the top most connection is tried first, followed by the second, and so on. After
    a connection is established, other endpoints might be retrieved and used if the
    configured connector endpoint is down. You must define at least one connector
    in an ODR connector group but cannot define more than 16 connectors.
