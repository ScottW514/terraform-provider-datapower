# datapower_loadbalancergroup (Resource)

<p>The DataPower device distributes traffic to members of a Load Balancer Group. These are back end servers and not additional DataPower devices. A Load Balancer Group lists members of a virtual server group and sets the algorithm for balancing them. Periodic health checks can be performed. Load Balancers may also be used to provide redundant LDAP server access.</p><p>When created, a DataPower service can use a Load Balancer Group by associating it with an XML manager that is associated with this service.</p><p>The back end destination URL is set to the name of the Load Balancer Group (example: "BackEndServers").</p>
  - CLI Alias: `loadbalancer-group`

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "datapower_loadbalancergroup" "test" {
  id            = "ResTestLoadBalancerGroup"
  app_domain    = "acceptance_test"
  algorithm     = "round-robin"
  retrieve_info = false
  damp          = 120
}
```
