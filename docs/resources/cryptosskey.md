# datapower_cryptosskey (Resource)

A shared secret key is a sequence of characters that is pre-shared between users for use with symmetric encryption.
  - CLI Alias: `sskey`

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "datapower_cryptosskey" "test" {
  id         = "ResTestCryptoSSKey"
  app_domain = "acceptance_test"
  filename   = "cert://tokensecret"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `app_domain` (String) The name of the application domain the object belongs to
- `filename` (String) Specify the file that contains the shared secret key. If the file begins with <tt>0x</tt> , processing assumes that the rest of the file contains bytes in hex. You can access the file in the <tt>cert:</tt> or <tt>local:</tt> directory. <p><b>Attention:</b> Any file in the <tt>local:</tt> directory can be downloaded or included in an export. Therefore, consider whether to store crypto files in this directory.</p>
  - CLI Alias: `file-name`
- `id` (String) Name of the object. Must be unique among object types in application domain.

### Optional

- `dependency_actions` (Attributes List) Actions to take on other resources when operations are performed on this resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--dependency_actions))
