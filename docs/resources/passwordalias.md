  The password map alias provides the mapping of an alias to a plaintext password. The alias is a publicly known reference that is included in configuration files and exports. With an alias you keep the real password secret because the plaintext value for the password is stored in an encrypted file. The password for the alias cannot be viewed or accessed by anyone.
