# datapower_amqpsourceprotocolhandler (Resource)

In AMQP, distributed source and target termini are managed by a broker. The broker periodically monitors and polls termini. The broker ensures that sent messages are directed to the correct target terminus or are routed to another server. The AMQP broker configuration corresponds to an AMQP broker that is running on another host in the network.
  - CLI Alias: `source-amqp`
  - Accepted Dependency Actions: `quiesce`

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "datapower_amqpsourceprotocolhandler" "test" {
  id         = "ResTestAMQPSourceProtocolHandler"
  app_domain = "acceptance_test"
  broker     = "AccTest_AMQPBroker"
  from       = "amqpfrom"
}
```
