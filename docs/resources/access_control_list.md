  An access control list (ACL) consists of a sequence of allow and deny clauses. Each clause identifies an IP address or range of addresses that grants or denies access to a service. Candidate addresses are sequentially evaluated against each clause. A candidate address is granted or denied access in accordance with the first clause that matches.

  id         = "ResTestAccessControlList"
  app_domain = "acceptance_test"
  access_control_entry = [{
    access  = "allow"
    address = "10.0.0.0/8"
