# datapower_pop_poller_source_protocol_handler (Resource)

The Post Office Protocol (POP) handler manages the polling of a mailbox on a mail server. The mailbox receives mail messages from external partners. The handler retrieves and deletes mail messages on each polling cycle. Each mail message that The handler retrieves results in one transaction.
  - CLI Alias: `source-pop-poller`
  - Accepted Dependency Actions: `quiesce`

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "datapower_pop_poller_source_protocol_handler" "test" {
  id                    = "ResTestPOPPollerSourceProtocolHandler"
  app_domain            = "acceptance_test"
  mail_server           = "localhost"
  port                  = 8888
  conn_security         = "none"
  account               = "account"
  password_alias        = "AccTest_PasswordAlias"
  delay_between_polls   = 300
  max_messages_per_poll = 5

  - Default value: `none`
- `delay_between_polls` (Number) Specify the interval in seconds between polling sequences. A <em>polling sequence</em> is the time to retrieve the messages plus the time to complete their processing. Enter a value in the range 1 - 65535.

- `max_messages_per_poll` (Number) Specify the maximum number of messages to retrieve in each polling cycle. Enter a value in the range 1 - 100. The default value is 5.
  - CLI Alias: `max-messages-per-poll`
  - Range: `1`-`100`
  - Default value: `5`
- `ssl_client` (String) The TLS client profile to secure connections between the DataPower Gateway and its targets.
