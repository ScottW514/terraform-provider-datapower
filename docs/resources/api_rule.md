# datapower_api_rule (Resource)

An API rule completes the processing of API requests or completes the operations that are required by the API requests.
  - CLI Alias: `api-rule`

  id         = "ResTestAPIRule"
  app_domain = "acceptance_test"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `app_domain` (String) The name of the application domain the object belongs to
- `id` (String) Name of the object. Must be unique among object types in application domain.

### Optional

- `actions` (List of String) Specify the processing actions for the rule. With multiple actions, ensure that the actions are in the correct processing sequence.
  - CLI Alias: `action`
- `dependency_actions` (Attributes List) Actions to take on other resources when operations are performed on this resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--dependency_actions))
- `dynamic_actions` (Attributes List) Specify the dynamic actions for the rule. With multiple actions, ensure that the actions are in the correct processing sequence.
  - CLI Alias: `dynamic-action` (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--dynamic_actions))
- `dynamic_actions_mode` (Boolean) Specify whether to use dynamic actions instead of explicit actions. Dynamic actions take configuration values at run time and override the default properties in API actions. API rules that contain dynamic actions can be included in user-defined policies that API Connect advertises and makes available in the API Connect assembly editor.
  - CLI Alias: `dynamic-actions-mode`
  - Default value: `false`
- `user_summary` (String) Comments
  - CLI Alias: `summary`

  - CLI Alias: `literal`
- `url` (String) Specifies a URL to a file that contains serialized XML or JSON properties to be merged into the dynamic object. These properties override any existing literal or default properties. The URL can contain variable references, and fields within the associated file can also contain variable references.
  - CLI Alias: `url`
