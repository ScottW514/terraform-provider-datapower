# datapower_error_report_settings (Resource)

<p>Failure notification is a serviceability tool. By default, failure notification is disabled. To use failure notification, you must enable the configuration and allow the error report to be uploaded.</p><p>The uploading of an error report allows the capture of more diagnostic information, which safely improves serviceability. Although there is a tradeoff between performance and serviceability, you should choose serviceability by enabling the following properties:</p><ul><li>Include Internal State</li><li>Background Packet Capture</li><li>Background Log Capture</li><li>Background Memory Trace</li></ul><p>When you allow the error report to be uploaded, this setting enables the Failure Notification status provider. This status provide in combination with the report history tracks the error reports that the appliance generates, the reason why the appliance generated the error report, and its upload status to the specific destination.</p><p>You can specify an NFS, RAID, SMTP, or FTP destination. You can also specify the local temporary directory as the destination. The appliance generates error reports, the naming convention includes the serial number of the appliance and the timestamp of the report. This naming convention prevents one report from overwriting another.</p><p>You can use Event Triggers to generate error reports automatically when specific events occur.</p>

## Schema

### Optional

- `always_on_shutdown` (Boolean) <p>Specify whether the appliance generates an error report when it shuts down. When the appliance shuts down and when using the upload error report feature, the status provider lists <tt>on-shutdown</tt> as the reason code. If the appliance shuts down due to a crash, the status provider lists <tt>crash</tt> as the reason code.</p><p><b>Best Practices:</b></p><ul><li>In general enable this feature.</li><li>In particular when in production, enable this feature to make sure debugging information is captured when the appliance shuts down.</li></ul>
  - CLI Alias: `always-on-shutdown`
  - Default value: `true`
- `always_on_startup` (Boolean) <p>Specify whether the appliance generates an error report when it reboots or reloads. If this feature is enabled logs will be collected before they are overwritten when the system reloads. When the appliance reboots or reloads and when using the upload error report feature, the status provider lists <tt>on-start</tt> as the reason code. If the appliance reloads due to a crash, the status provider lists <tt>crash</tt> as the reason code.</p><p><b>Best Practices:</b></p><ul><li>In general enable this feature.</li><li>In particular when in production, enable this feature to track reloads and reboots.</li></ul>
  - CLI Alias: `always-on-startup`
  - Default value: `true`
- `dependency_actions` (Attributes List) Actions to take on other resources when operations are performed on this resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--dependency_actions))
- `email_address` (String) Specify the e-mail address to which to send the error report.
  - CLI Alias: `email-address`
  - Required When: (`use_smtp`=`true` OR (`upload_report`=`true` AND `protocol`=`smtp`))
- `email_sender_address` (String) Specify the e-mail address of the sender ( <tt>MAIL FROM</tt> ). If not specified, the configuration uses the e-mail address of the recipient.
  - CLI Alias: `email-sender-address`
- `enabled` (Boolean) <p>The administrative state of the configuration.</p><ul><li>To make active, set to enabled.</li><li>To make inactive, set to disabled.</li></ul>
  - CLI Alias: `admin-state`
  - Default value: `true`
- `ffdc_event_log_capture` (Boolean) <p>Specify whether to use a background log capture. This feature enables the capture of all log and trace points with minimal overhead. When enabled, this feature runs continuously.</p><p>If the appliance encounters a problem or a user triggers the generation of an error report, the error report includes data from this log capture. This data can help IBM Support identify the problem.</p><p>These messages are independent of messages written to log and trace targets.</p>
  - CLI Alias: `ffdc event-log`
  - Default value: `false`
- `ffdc_memory_leak_capture` (Boolean) <p>Specify whether to enable automatic leak detection. This feature finds gradual memory leaks that occur steadily over time. This feature does not help in situations where messages are larger than the appliance can parse.</p><p>When enabled and if memory falls below an internal threshold, the appliance tracks all memory allocations. When the appliance reaches a critical condition that will lead to a crash, it generates an error report that contains information about memory allocation.</p><p>The configuration of the Throttle Settings affects this feature. The throttle settings can prevent the appliance from reaching the internal threshold.</p>
  - CLI Alias: `ffdc memory-trace`
  - Default value: `false`
- `ffdc_packet_capture` (Boolean) <p>Specify whether to use a background packet capture. This feature enables network packet capture for all interfaces including the internal loopback interface. When enabled, this feature runs continuously.</p><p>If the appliance encounters a problem or a user triggers the generation of an error report, the error report includes the data from this packet capture data. This data helps to determine the messages that the appliance was processing when it encountered the problem.</p>
  - CLI Alias: `ffdc packet-capture`
  - Default value: `false`
- `ftp_path` (String) Specify the directory on the FTP server to which to upload the error report. Use <tt>%2F</tt> to specify an absolute path.
  - CLI Alias: `ftp-path`
- `ftp_server` (String) Specify the host name or IP address of the remote FTP server to which to upload the error report.
  - CLI Alias: `ftp-server`
  - Required When: (`upload_report`=`true` AND `protocol`=`ftp`)
- `ftp_user_agent` (String) Specify the User Agent that describes how to connect to remote FTP servers. In addition to the FTP Policy to define the connection, ensure that this User Agent defines the basic authentication policy (user name and password) to connect to the FTP server.
  - CLI Alias: `ftp-user-agent`

  - CLI Alias: `internal-state`
  - Default value: `false`
- `location_identifier` (String) Specify text to include in the subject of an e-mail notification. In general, this value should be how you identify this appliance in your environment. When using the upload error report feature, this property is not necessary. In this case, failure notification uses the serial number of the appliance and the timestamp of the error report.
  - CLI Alias: `location-id`
  - Required When: `use_smtp`=`true`
- `nf_sm_ount` (String) Specify the NFS mount point to which to upload the error report.
