# datapower_appsecuritypolicy (Resource)

An Application Security Policy establishes the rules to use to enforce security for a Web Application Firewall service. This policy employs request maps, response maps, and error maps that provide a detailed security configuration. Each of these maps, in turn, matches to a Web Request Profile, Web Request Profile, or Error Policy, as the case might be.
  - CLI Alias: `application-security-policy`

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "datapower_appsecuritypolicy" "test" {
  id         = "ResTestAppSecurityPolicy"
  app_domain = "acceptance_test"
  request_maps = [{
    match = "__default-accept-service-providers__"
    rule  = "AccTest_WebAppRequest"
  }]
  response_maps = [{
    match = "__default-accept-service-providers__"
    rule  = "AccTest_WebAppResponse"
  }]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `app_domain` (String) The name of the application domain the object belongs to
- `id` (String) Name of the object. Must be unique among object types in application domain.
- `request_maps` (Attributes List) A list of Web Request Profile objects and their matching criteria. If the client request meets the matching criteria, its Web Request Profile runs.
  - CLI Alias: `request-match` (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--request_maps))
- `response_maps` (Attributes List) A list of Web Response Profile objects and their matching criteria. If the server response meets the matching criteria, its Web Response Profile runs.
  - CLI Alias: `response-match` (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--response_maps))

### Optional

- `dependency_actions` (Attributes List) Actions to take on other resources when operations are performed on this resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--dependency_actions))
- `error_maps` (Attributes List) A list of Error Policy objects (Processing Rules) and their matching criteria. If an error meets the matching criteria, its Error Policy runs.
  - CLI Alias: `error-match` (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--error_maps))
- `user_summary` (String) Comments
  - CLI Alias: `summary`
