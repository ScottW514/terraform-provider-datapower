# datapower_amqpbroker (Resource)

In AMQP, distributed source and target termini are managed by a broker. The broker provides messaging services for communicating applications by periodically monitoring and polling termini. The broker ensures that sent messages are directed to the correct target terminus or are routed to another server. The AMQP broker configuration corresponds to an AMQP broker that is running on another host in the network. The configured properties enable communication between the DataPower Gateway and the remote AMQP broker.
  - CLI Alias: `amqp-broker`

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "datapower_amqpbroker" "test" {
  id            = "ResTestAMQPBroker"
  app_domain    = "acceptance_test"
  host_name     = "host.name"
  port          = 5672
  xml_manager   = "default"
  authorization = "none"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `app_domain` (String) The name of the application domain the object belongs to
- `host_name` (String) Host
  - CLI Alias: `hostname`
- `id` (String) Name of the object. Must be unique among object types in application domain.

### Optional

- `authorization` (String) Specify the SASL layer that the AMQP broker uses to authenticate with the AMQP server. The default setting in no authentication.
  - CLI Alias: `authorization`
  - Choices: `none`, `anonymous`, `plain`
  - Default value: `none`
- `auto_retry` (Boolean) Specify whether to enable the automatic retry procedure after an AMQP connection failure. By default, the automatic retry behavior is enabled. This setting does not affect attempts over an established connection.
  - CLI Alias: `auto-retry`
  - Default value: `true`
- `container_id` (String) AMQP container ID
  - CLI Alias: `container-id`
- `dependency_actions` (Attributes List) Actions to take on other resources when operations are performed on this resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--dependency_actions))
- `long_retry_interval` (Number) Specify the interval in seconds to use after the number of attempts is reached to attempt to reestablish a failed connection. Enter a value in the range 1 - 65535. The default value is 600. <p>This setting does not affect attempts over an established connection.</p>
  - CLI Alias: `long-retry-interval`
  - Range: `1`-`86400`
  - Default value: `600`
- `maximum_frame_size` (Number) Specify the maximum frame size in bytes to allow. Frames Frames that are larger are rejected. When rejected, the connection is closed. Enter a value in the range 512 - 104857600. The default value is 104857600.
  - CLI Alias: `maximum-frame-size`
  - Range: `512`-`104857600`
  - Default value: `104857600`
- `password_alias` (String) Password alias
  - CLI Alias: `password-alias`
  - Reference to: `datapower_passwordalias:id`
- `port` (Number) Port
  - CLI Alias: `port`
  - Range: `1`-`65535`
  - Default value: `5672`
- `reporting_interval` (Number) Specify the interval in seconds between the writing of identical log message. Enter a value in the range 1 - 65535. The default value is 10.
  - CLI Alias: `reporting-interval`
  - Range: `1`-`86400`
  - Default value: `10`
- `retry_attempts` (Number) Specify the number of attempts for a failed connection to the remote AMQP server. After the number of attempts is reached, the long retry interval is used. Enter a value in the range 0 - 65535. The default value is 6. The special value of 0 disables the long interval, where the retry interval is used forever.
  - CLI Alias: `retry-attempts`
  - Default value: `6`
- `retry_interval` (Number) Specify the interval in seconds to wait before attempting to reestablish a failed connection. After the number of attempts is reached, attempts to reestablish a failed connection use the interval that is defined by the long retry interval. Enter a value in the range 1 - 65535. The default value is 10. <p>This setting does not affect attempts over an established connection.</p>
  - CLI Alias: `retry-interval`
  - Range: `1`-`86400`
  - Default value: `10`
- `ssl_client` (String) TLS client profile
  - CLI Alias: `ssl-client`
  - Reference to: `datapower_sslclientprofile:id`
