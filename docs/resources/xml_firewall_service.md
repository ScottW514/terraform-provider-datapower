When attached to a service, an Access Control List (ACL) denies all access by default. To deny access to only selected addresses, first grant access to all addresses (allow 0.0.0.0) and then create deny entries for the desired hosts.
  - CLI Alias: `acl`
  - Reference to: `datapower_access_control_list:id`
- `always_show_errors` (Boolean) If set, HTTP responses may be generated with errors appended to partially generated documents. If not set error responses will only be sent to the browser if no other output has been created.
  - CLI Alias: `always-show-errors`

  - CLI Alias: `debug-history`
  - Range: `10`-`250`
  - Default value: `25`
- `debug_mode` (String) <p>Select the diagnostic mode for processing policies. When enabled, you can view details about the state of variables and contexts for a captured transaction in the probe. The default value is <tt>off</tt> .</p><p>Transaction diagnostic mode is not intended for use in a production environment. Transaction diagnostic mode consumes significant resources that can slow down transaction processing.</p>
  - CLI Alias: `debug-mode`
  - Choices: `on`, `off`, `unbounded`
  - Default value: `off`
- `debug_trigger` (Attributes List) The probe captures transactions that meet one or more of the conditions defined by the triggers. These triggers examine the direction or type of the message flow and examine the message for an XPath expression match. When a message meets one of these conditions, the transaction is captured in diagnostics mode and becomes part of the list of transactions that can be viewed.
  - CLI Alias: `debug-trigger` (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--debug_trigger))
- `default_param_namespace` (String) If a stylesheet parameter is defined without a namespace (or without explicitly specifying the null namespace), then this is the namespace into which the parameter will be assigned.

  - CLI Alias: `delay-errors`
  - Default value: `true`
- `delay_errors_duration` (Number) When enabling the delay of error messages, specify the delay duration in milliseconds. If delaying messages for 3000 ms, the DataPower Gateway will not send error messages to the client until 3 seconds have elapsed since the DataPower Gateway performed decryption on the requests.

- `disallow_get` (Boolean) If set, only methods with incoming data (such as POST) are allowed.
  - CLI Alias: `disallow-get`
  - Default value: `false`
- `do_chunked_upload` (Boolean) Use the radio buttons to enable (on) or disable (off) the ability to send Content-Type Chunked Encoded documents to the back end server. When the device employs the HTTP/1.1 protocol, the body of the document can be delimited by either Content-Length or chunked encodings. While all servers will understand how to interpret Content-Length, many applications will fail to understand Chunked encoding. For this reason, Content-Length is the standard method used. However doing so interferes with the ability of the device to fully stream. To stream full documents towards the back end server, this property should be turned on. However, the back end server must be RFC 2616 compatible, because this feature cannot be renegotiated at run time, unlike all other HTTP/1.1 features which can be negotiated down at runtime if necessary. This property can also be enabled by configuring a User Agent to enable it on a per-URL basis.
  - CLI Alias: `chunked-uploads`
  - Default value: `false`
- `do_host_rewrite` (Boolean) When enabled, the device will rewrite the Host: header to be the address of the back-end server. This is not what a strict proxy would do, and may not be appropriate for all topologies.

  - Default value: `true`
- `duration_monitors` (List of String) Duration Monitors watch for events meeting or exceeding a configured duration. When a duration is met or exceeded, the monitor can either post a notification to a log or block service for a configured amount of time. Select a Duration Monitor from the list to activate that monitor for this firewall. Click the + button to create a new Duration Monitor.
  - CLI Alias: `monitor-duration`
  - Reference to: `datapower_duration_monitor:id`
- `firewall_parser_limits` (Boolean) Use the firewall parser limits instead of the parser limits in the XML Manager for this firewall. Firewall limits override XML Manager limits.
  - CLI Alias: `firewall-parser-limits`
  - Default value: `false`
- `force_policy_exec` (Boolean) <p>Some message patterns may include bodyless request and response messages. This is common with RESTful web services where messages may or may not include a body but still requires the processing policy to run. To enable this capability for services whose request and response type is XML (or marked as non-XML i.e. JSON), set this option to 'on'. By doing so, the processing policy rules will always be executed.</p>
  - CLI Alias: `force-policy-exec`
  - Default value: `false`
- `front_attachment_format` (String) Select how to interpret client requests with attachments. If an attachment arrives that is not of the type chosen, the attachment will be rejected.

  - CLI Alias: `suppress` (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--header_suppression))
- `http_client_ip_label` (String) Retain the default value (X-Client-IP) or provide an other value (for example, X-Forwarded-For).
  - CLI Alias: `client-address`

- `http_compression` (Boolean) Toggle to enable or disable the GZIP compression function.
  - CLI Alias: `compression`
  - Default value: `false`
- `http_include_response_type_encoding` (Boolean) Toggle to enable or disable including the character set encoding in the HTTP content-type header produced. For example, when sending a UTF-8 encoded XML document: If this property is disabled, 'content-type=text/xml' will be sent. If this property is enabled, 'content-type=text/xml; charset=UTF-8' will be sent.
  - CLI Alias: `include-response-type-encoding`
  - Default value: `false`

These MIME headers can contain important information not available in the protocol headers, such as the string identifying the MIME boundary. If this property is set to on, then these MIME headers will be processed by the Firewall.</p><p>Note that if this is on and there are no MIME headers contained in the message, the device will continue to try and parse the message, using the protocol header information, if available.</p><p>When this is off and MIME headers are present in the body of the message, these MIME headers will be considered part of the preamble and not used to parse out the message. If the protocol headers (such as HTTP) indicate the MIME boundaries, the device can parse and process individual attachments. If such information is not available, no attachments can be parsed from the body of the message.</p>
