# datapower_multi_protocol_gateway (Resource)

<p>A Multi-Protocol Gateway service can accept client-originated messages in a variety of protocols. The Gateway can subsequently pass messages to a back end server using a variety of protocols. The protocol used on the client side need not be the same as that on the back side.</p><p>A Gateway can support more than one client, or Front Side, protocol. Similarly, the Gateway can support more than one back side, or server protocol. The messages may be processed and routed using any of the standard Document Processing Actions available to a firewall or a proxy.</p>
  - CLI Alias: `mpgw`
  - Accepted Dependency Actions: `quiesce`

  - CLI Alias: `backend-url`
- `count_monitors` (List of String) Specify the count monitors to define messaging events and increment counters each time the event occurs. When a certain threshold is reached, the monitor can either post a notification to a log or block service for a configured amount of time.
  - CLI Alias: `monitor-count`
  - Reference to: `datapower_count_monitor:id`
- `debug_history` (Number) Set the number of records for transaction diagnostic mode in the probe. Enter a value in the range 10 - 250. The default value is 25.
  - CLI Alias: `debug-history`
  - Range: `10`-`250`
  - Default value: `25`
- `debug_mode` (String) <p>Select the diagnostic mode for processing policies. When enabled, you can view details about the state of variables and contexts for a captured transaction in the probe. The default value is <tt>off</tt> .</p><p>Transaction diagnostic mode is not intended for use in a production environment. Transaction diagnostic mode consumes significant resources that can slow down transaction processing.</p>
  - CLI Alias: `debug-mode`
  - Choices: `on`, `off`, `unbounded`
  - Default value: `off`
- `debug_trigger` (Attributes List) The probe captures transactions that meet one or more of the conditions defined by the triggers. These triggers examine the direction or type of the message flow and examine the message for an XPath expression match. When a message meets one of these conditions, the transaction is captured in diagnostics mode and becomes part of the list of transactions that can be viewed.
  - CLI Alias: `debug-trigger` (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--debug_trigger))
- `default_param_namespace` (String) If a stylesheet parameter is defined without a namespace (or without explicitly specifying the null namespace), then this is the namespace into which the parameter will be assigned.
  - CLI Alias: `default-param-namespace`
  - Default value: `http://www.datapower.com/param/config`
- `delay_errors` (Boolean) The timing difference of the error messages returned after a decryption action can provide an attacker with enough information to determine the contents of the plain-text data. When enabled, the default, the DataPower Gateway delays error messages for the defined duration. When disabled, the DataPower Gateway does not delay error messages.
  - CLI Alias: `delay-errors`
  - Default value: `true`
- `delay_errors_duration` (Number) When enabling the delay of error messages, specify the delay duration in milliseconds. If delaying messages for 3000ms, the DataPower Gateway will not send error messages to the client until 3 seconds have elapsed since the DataPower Gateway performed decryption on the requests. Enter a value in the range 250 - 300000. The default value is 1000.
  - CLI Alias: `delay-errors-duration`
  - Range: `250`-`300000`

- `dependency_actions` (Attributes List) Actions to take on other resources when operations are performed on this resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--dependency_actions))
- `do_chunked_upload` (Boolean) Specify whether to enable (on) or disable (off) the ability to send Content-Type Chunked Encoded documents to the back end server. When the device employs the HTTP/1.1 protocol, the body of the document can be delimited by either Content-Length or chunked encodings. While all servers will understand how to interpret Content-Length, many applications will fail to understand Chunked encoding. For this reason, Content-Length is the standard method used. However doing so interferes with the ability of the device to fully stream. To stream full documents towards the back end server, this property should be turned on. However, the back end server must be RFC 2616 compatible, because this feature cannot be renegotiated at run time, unlike all other HTTP/1.1 features which can be negotiated down at runtime if necessary. This property can also be enabled by configuring a User Agent to enable it on a per-URL basis.
  - CLI Alias: `chunked-uploads`
  - Default value: `false`
- `do_host_rewriting` (Boolean) Some protocols have distinct name-based elements, separate from the URL, to demultiplex. HTTP uses the <tt>Host</tt> header for this purposes. If this feature is enabled, the remote server will receive a request that reflects the final route; otherwise, it will receive a request that reflects the information as it arrived at the DataPower service. Web servers that issue redirects might want to disable this feature, as they often depend on the <tt>Host</tt> header for the value of their redirect.
  - CLI Alias: `host-rewriting`
  - Default value: `true`
- `duration_monitors` (List of String) Specify the duration monitors to watch for events that meet or exceed a configured duration. When a duration is met or exceeded, the monitor can either post a notification to a log or block service for a configured amount of time.
  - CLI Alias: `monitor-duration`
  - Reference to: `datapower_duration_monitor:id`
- `enable_compressed_payload_passthrough` (Boolean) Specify whether to enable or disable the decompression of the response payload when the backside response is compressed. When enabled, the payload is not decompressed but passed through compressed.
  - CLI Alias: `enable-compressed-payload-passthrough`
  - Default value: `false`
- `error_policy` (String) Assign an error policy to the service. The error policy defines the actions to take against errors in an HTTP or HTTPS flow that no precedent error handler handles.
  - CLI Alias: `error-policy`
  - Reference to: `datapower_mpgw_error_handling_policy:id`
- `flow_control` (Boolean) <p>Use flow control to manage the transmission of large files when the front side and back end have different latencies and throughput while in streaming mode. This option is available when the request type and the response type are Pass-Thru or Non-XML. By default, flow control is disabled.</p><p>Note that the streaming behavior for output to back and output to front must be set to Stream Messages. Also, if either the front side or the back end will use the HTTP(S) protocol, allow chunked uploads must be set to on.</p>
  - CLI Alias: `flowcontrol`
  - Default value: `false`
- `follow_redirects` (Boolean) Some protocols generate redirects as part of the protocol - for example HTTP response code 302. If this property is enabled the gateway tries to transparently resolve those redirects.
  - CLI Alias: `follow-redirects`
  - Default value: `true`
- `force_policy_exec` (Boolean) <p>Some message patterns could include bodyless request and response messages. This approach is common with RESTful Web services where messages might not include a body but still requires the processing policy to run. To enable this capability for services whose request and response type is XML, JSON, or marked as non-XML, set this option to 'on'. By doing so, the processing policy rules will always be run.</p>
  - CLI Alias: `force-policy-exec`
  - Default value: `false`

  - CLI Alias: `front-persistent-timeout`
  - Range: `0`-`86400`
  - Default value: `180`
- `front_protocol` (List of String) Specify a protocol handler to determine the network communication protocol, address, port, and other protocol-specific settings.
  - CLI Alias: `front-protocol`

  - CLI Alias: `include-content-type-encoding`
  - Default value: `false`
- `load_balancer_hash_header` (String) Enter the name of an HTTP Header to use rather than a Client IP address when load balancing traffic to the back end servers using a hash algorithm. The value of the header identified here will be used to calculate a hash rather than the IP address. If blank, the client IP address will be used for hash calculation.
  - CLI Alias: `load-balancer-hash-header`
- `loop_detection` (Boolean) Some protocols provide a loop detection mechanism that can be used to detect gateway loops. This is a good policy, but it can cause each gateway to be publicly recorded in the transmitted message, which might be considered an information leak.
  - CLI Alias: `loop-detection`
  - Default value: `false`
- `max_message_size` (Number) <p>Specifies the maximum allowable size in kilobytes of a message. Enter a value in the range 0 - 2097151. The default value is 0. A value of 0 specifies that no limit is enforced, and the message can be of unlimited size.</p><p>The maximum message size limit applies to JSON, SOAP, XML, and non-XML messages. If the message type is pass-through, no limit is enforced.</p>
  - CLI Alias: `max-message-size`
  - Range: `0`-`2097151`
- `mime_back_headers` (Boolean) <p>The body of a message (the payload independent of protocol headers) can sometimes contain MIME headers before any preamble and before the first MIME boundary in the body of the message. These MIME headers can contain important information that is not available in the protocol headers, such as a string that identifies the MIME boundary. If this property is set to on, these MIME headers are processed by the service.</p><p>When set to on and there are no MIME headers in the message, the device continues to try and parse the message, using the protocol header information, if available.</p><p>When set to off and MIME headers are present in the body of the message, these MIME headers are considered part of the preamble and not used to parse the message. If protocol headers, such as HTTP, indicate MIME boundaries, the device can parse and process individual attachments. If such information is not available, no attachments can be parsed from the body of the message.</p>
  - CLI Alias: `mime-back-headers`
  - Default value: `true`
- `mime_front_headers` (Boolean) <p>The body of a message (that is, the payload, independent of any protocol headers) can sometimes contain MIME headers before any preamble and before the first MIME boundary contained in the body of the message. These MIME headers can contain important information not available in the protocol headers, such as the string identifying the MIME boundary. If this property is set to on, then these MIME headers will be processed by the service.</p><p>Note that if this is on and there are no MIME headers contained in the message, the device will continue to try and parse the message, using the protocol header information, if available.</p><p>When this is off and MIME headers are present in the body of the message, these MIME headers will be considered part of the preamble and not used to parse out the message. If the protocol headers (such as HTTP) indicate the MIME boundaries, the device can parse and process individual attachments. If such information is not available, no attachments can be parsed from the body of the message.</p>
  - CLI Alias: `mime-front-headers`
  - Default value: `true`
- `monitor_processing_policy` (String) Select the way that the system behaves when more than one monitor is attached to a service.

If the client submits http://host/service and the backend URL is http://server/listener, the URL is rewritten to http://server/service.</p><p>If the backend URL employs AMQP, IBM MQ, Kafka, TIBCO EMS, or WebSphere JMS, set to <b>off</b>.</p>
  - CLI Alias: `propagate-uri`
  - Default value: `true`
- `proxy_http_response` (Boolean) When you enable this setting, the service passes the response code from the server to the client without modification. If an error occurs when the service runs the response rule, the service does not pass the response code but returns the default error code, which is an HTTP 500. If you require the service to pass the response code in this error condition, set the <tt>var://service/mpgw/proxy-http-response</tt> variable to 1 in the request or response rule. However, when you set a custom response code in the error rule with the <tt>var://service/error-protocol-response</tt> variable, the service passes this custom response code instead.

This also applies to the retransmission of a CreateSequence, CloseSequence, or TerminateSequence SOAP requests. If Front Exponential Backoff is enabled, this is the initial timeout. Use any value of 2 - 600. The default is 10.</p><p>This property is relevant only when WS-ReliableMessaging and when Source Create Sequence on Request, Source Create Sequence on Response, or Destination Accept Two-Way Offers are enabled.</p>
  - CLI Alias: `wsrm-source-retransmission-interval`
  - Range: `2`-`600`
  - Default value: `10`
- `wsrm_uses_sequence_ssl` (Boolean) <p>Use the WS-ReliableMessaging (WS-RM) SSL/TLS security model for protecting the integrity and security of messages sent from RM Sources for this gateway. This provides confidentiality (through SSL/TLS) and protects the WS-RM state from alteration by unauthorized parties.</p><p>Outgoing CreateSequence control messages will have the UsesSequenceTLS SOAP header block. This will tell the peer RM Destination that all control and data messages for this conversation must use the same SSL/TLS session. Any message to that RM Destination Identifier that is not associated with the same SSL/TLS session will be rejected.</p><p>The lifetime of a SSL/TLS protected Sequence will be limited by the lifetime of the SSL/TLS session that is used to protect that Sequence.</p><p>Acceptance and enforcement of UsesSequenceTLS on incoming WS-RM connections to RM Destinations is automatic if TLS is enabled.</p><p>This property is relevant only when WS-ReliableMessaging and when Source Create Sequence on Request, Source Create Sequence on Response, or Destination Accept Two-Way Offers are enabled.</p>
  - CLI Alias: `wsrm-source-sequence-ssl`
  - Default value: `false`
- `wsrmaaa_policy` (String) <p>Specify the AAA Policy to perform authentication of incoming WS-ReliableMessaging (WS-RM) messages. While this is focused on protecting the WS-RM control SOAP messages, such as CreateSequence and TerminateSequence, it is also run on incoming WS-RM data messages with a Sequence header. This prevents unauthorized clients from using system resources by issuing CreateSequence requests, or from disrupting existing WS-RM sequences using CloseSequence or TerminateSequence messages, or from falsely acknowledging messages using SequenceAcknowledgement messages. This would normally be the same AAA Policy used in later processing by the request or response rules, the results are cached so it is not evaluated again.</p><p>Note that this also applies to a CreateSequence request received from the server. If the server is not providing this authentication information, configure to have the RM Source make offers.</p><p>This property is relevant only when WS-RM is enabled.</p>
  - CLI Alias: `wsrm-aaa-policy`

- `wsrr_subscriptions` (Attributes List) The Gateway services endpoints based on the metadata obtained using these subscriptions.
  - CLI Alias: `wsrr-subscription` (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--wsrr_subscriptions))
- `xml_manager` (String) <p>An XML Manager manages the compilation and caching of style sheets, the caching of documents, and provides configuration constraints on the size and parsing depth of documents. You can enable streaming operation by configuring an XML Manager to use a Streaming Compile Option Policy.</p><p>Optionally, an XML Manager can employ a User Agent. The User Agent settings, in turn, can affect the behavior of the gateway when communicating with remote servers or with clients when sending back responses.</p>
