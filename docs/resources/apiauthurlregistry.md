## Schema

### Required

- `app_domain` (String) The name of the application domain the object belongs to

When the user is authenticated, DataPower expects the authentication endpoint to return an HTTP 200 status code. All other status codes result in an authentication failure, and access is denied.
  - CLI Alias: `auth-url`
- `id` (String) Name of the object. Must be unique among object types in application domain.

### Optional

  - CLI Alias: `tls-client`
  - Reference to: `datapower_sslclientprofile:id`
