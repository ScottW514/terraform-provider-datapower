- `assembly_count_limit` (Attributes List) Assembly count limits (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--assembly_count_limit))
- `assembly_rate_limit` (Attributes List) Assembly rate limits (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--assembly_rate_limit))
- `cache_memory_size` (Number) Specify the maximum size of the stylesheet cache. The default value is 2147483647. A value of 0 disables caching. Stylesheets are purged when either the cache size or the cache count is reached.
- `cache_size` (Number) Specify the maximum number of stylesheets to cache. Enter a value in the range 5 - 250000. The default value is 256. Stylesheets are purged when either the cache size or the cache count is reached.
- `doc_cache_max_docs` (Number) Specify the maximum number of documents to cache. Enter a value in the range 1 - 250000. The default value is 5000.
- `doc_cache_policy` (Attributes List) Specify the document cache policies to associate a set of URLs with a specific cache policy. A document cache policy allows the administrator to determine how documents are cached. The policy offers time-to-live, priority, and type. The document cache is distinct from the stylesheet cache. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--doc_cache_policy))
- `doc_cache_size` (Number) Specify the maximum size of the document cache. Regardless of the specified size, no document that is greater than 1073741824 bytes is cached. This restriction applies even if the cache has available space.
- `doc_max_writes` (Number) Specify the maximum number of concurrent write requests to create documents or refresh expired documents in the document cache. Enter a value in the range 1 - 32768. The default value is 32768. After the maximum number is reached, requests are forwarded to the target server and the response is not written to the cache.
- `front_persistent_timeout` (Number) Specify the inter-transaction timeout for client connections. This value is the maximum idle time to allow between the completion of a transaction and the initiation of a new transaction for a client connection. If the specified idle time is exceeded, the connection is torn down. Enter a value in the range 0 - 86400. The default value is 180. A value of 0 disables persistent connections.
- `front_protocol` (List of String) Protocol handler (reference to HTTP or HTTPS Source Protocol Hander)
- `front_timeout` (Number) Specify the intra-transaction timeout for client connections. This value is the maximum idle time to allow in a transaction for a client connection. This timer monitors idle time in the data transfer process. If the specified idle time is exceeded, the connection is torn down. Enter a value in the range 1 - 86400. The default value is 120.

- `proxy_policies` (Attributes List) Specify the proxy policies to associate a set of URLs with a specific HTTP proxy. When multiple proxy policies are defined, URLs are evaluated against each policy in order. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--proxy_policies))
- `scheduled_rule` (Attributes List) Specify the processing rules to run at defined intervals. Certain applications require the running of a processing rule. For example, the integration with a CA Unicenter Manager is facilitated by a regularly scheduled processing rule that obtains relationship data from the Unicenter Manager. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--scheduled_rule))
- `sha1caching` (Boolean) Specify how to manage SHA1-assisted stylesheet caching. With SHA1 caching enabled, stylesheets are cached by both URL and SHA1 message digest value. With SHA1 caching disabled, stylesheets are cached only by URL.
- `share_rate_limit_count` (String) Share rate limit count
- `static_document_calls` (Boolean) Specify how to manage static document calls. The latest XSLT specifications require that multiple document calls in the same transformation return the same result. Disable this setting to allow all document calls to operate independently.
- `url_refresh_policy` (String) Specify the stylesheet refresh policy. Stylesheets cached by this gateway are refreshed in accordance with policy rules.
- `user_summary` (String) Comments
- `virtual_servers` (List of String) Load balancer groups

- `cache_backend_responses` (Boolean) Caches responses to requests from back-end servers.
  - CLI Alias: `cache-backend-response`
  - Default value: `false`
- `cache_unsafe_response` (Boolean) Caches responses to POST and PUT requests when the cache policy type is set to fixed. The response to these requests is the result of an action on the server that might change its resource state. You might want to cache responses to these requests when you know that the action (for example: HTTP POST) will not change the server state.
  - CLI Alias: `cache-unsafe-response`
  - Default value: `false`
- `http_cache_validation` (Boolean) When a requested HTTP document results in a cache hit, HTTP cache validation with the origin server is performed.
  - CLI Alias: `http-cache-validation`
  - Default value: `false`
- `match` (String) Provide a literal or wildcard expression to define a URL set included in the cache policy. The following wildcard characters are available. <table><tr><td valign="top">asterisk (*)</td><td valign="top">Matches 0 or more occurrences of any character.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">question mark (?)</td><td valign="top">Matches one occurrence of any single character.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">brackets ( [ ] )</td><td valign="top">Defines a character or numeric range. For example, <tt>[1-5]</tt> matches 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, while <tt>xs[dl]</tt> matches xsd or xsl.</td></tr></table>
  - CLI Alias: `match`
- `priority` (Number) <p>Specifies the priority of a document to add to or remove from the cache. The greater the value, the higher its priority. Enter a value in the range 1 - 255. The default value is 128.</p><ul><li>When adding documents, the cache uses the policy with the highest priority. If the document matches multiple policies with the same priority, the cache uses the first matching policy in the alphabetized list.</li><li>When removing documents, the cache removes documents that were added by policies with the lowest priority. If multiple documents have the same priority, the cache removes the document that was least recently accessed.</li></ul><p>When you define multiple policies, the DataPower Gateway retains the policies in an alphabetized list. The DataPower Gateway evaluates candidate documents against each policy. Consequently, the priority of policies is important to ensure that the DataPower Gateway caches candidate documents for the appropriate validity period.</p><ul><li>Use a high priority for policies that you want to cache.</li><li>Use a low priority for generic policies. For example, set the priority to 1 when <tt>*</tt> or <tt>*.xml</tt> is the match pattern.</li></ul>
  - CLI Alias: `priority`
  - Range: `1`-`255`
  - Default value: `128`
- `rest_invalidation` (Boolean) Invalidate document cache on unsafe requests. For example, HTTP GET requests are safe requests that do not change the internal state of the server. When an HTTP POST to the same URL occurs, the cache needs to be invalidated because the internal state of the server might have changed. The next GET request must contact the origin service to update the cache with any changes.
  - CLI Alias: `rest-invalidation`
  - Default value: `false`
- `return_expired` (Boolean) <p>In the following situations, whether to return expired content when a client requests it. <ul><li>The DataPower Gateway cannot establish a connection with the origin server.</li><li>The document cache is getting the newest version from the origin server.</li></ul></p><p>A document might persist in the cache after the document is expired. When enabled, the cached document is returned even though it is potentially stale. A warning header indicates that the document is stale.</p>
  - CLI Alias: `return-expired`
  - Default value: `false`
- `ttl` (Number) Sets the validity period in seconds for documents in the cache. TTL applies to only the <tt>Fixed</tt> policy type. Enter a value in the range 5 - 31708800. The default value is 900.
  - CLI Alias: `ttl`
  - Range: `0`-`31708800`
  - Default value: `900`
- `type` (String) Select the cache type. The cache type determines whether to cache documents and the mechanism to use to remove cached entries. The default value is Protocol-Based.

  - Choices: `protocol`, `no-cache`, `fixed`
  - Default value: `protocol`
- `xc10grid` (String) The eXtreme Scale grid configuration to use for caching documents.
