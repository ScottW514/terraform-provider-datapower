# datapower_aaa_policy (Data Source)

<p>Define the support to authenticate users and authorize their access to resources. An AAA policy consists of the following phases.</p><ul><li>During AAA processing, the identity extraction phase defines which methods the AAA policy uses to extract the claimed identity of the service requester.</li><li>After the claimed identity of the service requester is extracted, an AAA policy authenticates the claimed identity. The authentication process can use internal or external resources.</li><li>After authentication credentials are received, an AAA policy can map these credentials.</li><li>After client authentication, an AAA policy identifies the specific resource that is being requested by that client.</li><li>After requested resources are identified, you might need to map extracted resource to a form that is compatible with the authorization method.</li><li>After the service requester is authenticated from the extracted identity, an AAA policy authorizes the client to the requested resource.</li><li>After client-authorization, an AAA policy can run postprocessing activities.</li></ul>

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "datapower_aaa_policy" "test" {
  id         = "AccTest_AAAPolicy"

### Nested Schema for `result`

Read-Only:

- `app_domain` (String) The name of the application domain the object belongs to

- `authenticate` (Attributes) Specify the method to authenticate the extracted identity. For some methods, you must define more properties.
  - CLI Alias: `authenticate` (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--authenticate))
- `authorize` (Attributes) Specify the method to authorize the identity to resources. For some methods, you must define more properties.
  - CLI Alias: `authorize` (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--authorize))
- `authorized_counter` (String) Specify the monitor for authorized messages. Ensure that this count monitor is configured with an XPath as the measure.
- `az_sm_http_header` (List of String) Specify HTTP headers from CA Single Sign-On authorization responses. These headers are included as request or response headers based on the CA Single Sign-On header flow.
- `dos_valve` (Number) <p>Specify the number of times to process the same request to protect against a denial of service (DoS) attack. Enter a value in the range 1 - 1000. The default value is 3.</p><p>With the default value, AAA processes only the first 3 signature and each signature can contain up to 3 reference URIs. Additional signatures or reference URIs are ignored.</p><p>XML processing includes encryption, decryption, message signing, and signature validation. The AAA policy supports only identity extraction with subject DN from certificate in message signature and authorization with signer certificate for digitally signed messages.</p>
- `dyn_config` (String) Specify how to obtain the AAA policy configuration dynamically. With dynamic configuration, you can configure the AAA policy at run time. When enabled, the configuration of AAA is determined dynamically based on the template AAA policy and the parameters that the dynamic configuration custom URL returns. By default, uses no template.

This setting takes effect only when the AAA policy attempts to process the incoming message before it makes an authorization decision. Postprocessing does not use this setting. Postprocessing uses its own setting in generating the message for the next SOAP node. The default value is an empty string. <table border="1"><tr><td valign="left"><tt>http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/actor/next</tt></td><td>Every one, including the intermediary and ultimate receiver, that receives the message can process the <tt>Security</tt> header.</td></tr><tr><td valign="left"><tt>http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope/role/none</tt></td><td>No one can process the <tt>Security</tt> header.</td></tr><tr><td valign="left"><tt>http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope/role/next</tt></td><td>Every one, including the intermediary and ultimate receiver, that receives the message can process the <tt>Security</tt> header.</td></tr><tr><td valign="left"><tt>http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope/role/ultimateReceiver</tt></td><td>The ultimate receiver can process the <tt>Security</tt> header.</td></tr><tr><td valign="left">No value, which is an empty string</td><td>The empty string (without quotation marks) indicates that no "actor/role" identifier is configured.

If the value is an empty string, the audience for the <tt>ProxyRestriction</tt> is not issued with this SAML assertion. If there is more than one audience URI, use a + delimiter between URIs. In this case, you must convert any URI that contains the + characters to \+.
- `pp_saml_proxy_count` (Number) Specify the maximum number of indirections that the asserting party permits between this assertion and an assertion that was issued. Enter a value in the range 0 - 65535. The default value is 0. A value of 0 indicates that a relying party must not issue an assertion to another relying party based on this assertion. If greater than zero, any assertion that is issued must itself contain a <tt>ProxyRestriction</tt> element with a <tt>Count</tt> value of at most one less than this value.
- `pp_saml_recipient` (String) Specify a URI that identifies the entity or location that an attesting entity can present the assertion to. Any standard or arbitrary URI is allowed. If the value is an empty string, the optional attribute is not generated. This setting is applicable for only SAML 2.0.
- `pp_saml_response_destination` (String) Specify the destination for a SAML response. This information can prevent malicious forwarding of requests to unintended recipients, which is a required protection by some protocol bindings. If it is present, the actual recipient must check that the URI reference identifies the location at which the message was received. If it does not check that the URI reference identifies the location, the request must be discarded. Some protocol bindings might require the use of this attribute.
- `pp_saml_send_slo` (Boolean) <p>Specify whether to send a SAML Logout (SLO) request to revoke the SAML Assertion token that is used for single-sign-on (SSO). The SLO is a request-response that the DataPower&#174; Gateway handles differently when it is working as a service provider (SP) or identity provider (IdP).</p><ul><li>When an SP, the DataPower Gateway sends an SLO request to the SAML SLO endpoint (IdP). On response, the DataPower Gateway processes the SLO response for its status.</li><li>When an IdP, the request to the DataPower Gateway contains the SLO request. Postprocessing validates against the SAML metadata file and sends the corresponding endpoint the SLO response.</li></ul>
- `pp_saml_server_name` (String) <p>Specify the value of the <tt>saml:Issuer</tt> of the generated SAML assertion or SAML SLO request. The default value is XS.</p><ul><li>If generating an SAML assertion, identifies the server that makes the assertion.</li><li>If sending an SLO request, identifies the issuer that sends the request.</li></ul>
- `pp_saml_skew` (Number) Specify the acceptable skew interval in seconds. The IdP and SP system clocks can have a skew time. When the SAML assertion is generated, the expiration takes the skew time setting into account. <ul><li>When <tt>NotBefore</tt> has the value of <tt>(CurrentTime - SkewTime)</tt> .</li><li>When <tt>NotOnOrAfter</tt> has the value of <tt>(CurrentTime + Validity + SkewTime)</tt> .</li></ul>

- `pp_saml_use_ws_sec` (Boolean) Specify where to insert the SAML assertion. By default, the assertion is inserted as a child element of the SOAP header. When enabled, the assertion is inserted in a WS-Security-compliant header as defined by the WS-Security SAML token profile.
- `pp_saml_validity` (Number) Specify the validity duration of the SAML assertion in seconds. This value and the skew time are for fine control of the validity duration. The default value is 0.
- `pp_saml_version` (String) Specify the protocol level of SAML messages. The version affects the identity extraction from the original message and the format of messages. The default value is 1.1.
- `pp_shared_secret_key` (String) Specify the shared secret key as the WS-Trust key source.
- `pp_signing_hash_alg` (String) Specify the algorithm for the message digest for the generation of a digital signature. This algorithm is for only the UsernameToken postprocessing method. The default value is sha1.

- `pp_ssl_client_profile` (String) Specify the TLS client profile to secure connections.
- `pp_tam_header` (String) Specify the name of the HTTP header to store the token in. The default value is iv_creds, which is HTTP header that WebSEAL uses to write headers.
- `pp_tam_header_size` (Number) Specify the maximum size in bytes of HTTP headers. A value of 0 disables this function. If the value is nonzero, the PAC token is split across multiple headers of the specified length. The default value is 0.
- `pp_tam_pac_propagate` (Boolean) Specify whether to add the Access Manager privilege attribute certificate (PAC) token to an HTTP header. The PAC token was returned from the previous authentication or authorization phase. By default, does not add the PAC token. When enabled, adds the PAC token.
- `pp_timestamp` (Boolean) Specify whether to generate a WS-Trust token time stamp for the security token response.
- `pp_timestamp_expiry` (Number) Specify the validity duration for the WS-Trust SCT in seconds to issue a new security context or to renew a context instance with new instance. Enter a value in the range 0 - 31622400. The default value is 0, which uses the value of the <tt>var://system/AAA/defaultexpiry</tt> variable if defined. If you did not define this variable, the value is 14400. If this setting is to renew a security context or instance, the value 0 means to use the old duration for the renewed cycle.
- `pp_use_ws_sec` (Boolean) Specify whether the token can be wrapped by the WS-Security <tt>wsse:Security</tt> header. This setting for the LTPA token. By default, the token cannot be wrapped by this header. When enabled, generate a WS-Security header that contains the token.
- `pp_ws_derived_key_username_token` (Boolean) Specify whether to generate a derived key from a password. By default, a derived key is not generated. When enabled, the process adds a WS-Security derived-key UsernameToken to the message and adds an HMAC signature with the derived-key. The username and password are taken from the output of the map credentials phase.
- `pp_ws_derived_key_username_token_iterations` (Number) Specify the number of hashing cycles during the generation of a derived key from a password. The minimum value is 2. The default value is 1000.
- `pp_ws_sc_key_source` (String) Specify the source of the key. For WS-Trust postprocessing, the DataPower Gateway works as an on-box WS-Trust security token service that is backed by WS-SecureConversation. A symmetric shared secret key is needed to initialize the WS-SecureConversation SecurityContext. By default, a random key is generated.
- `pp_ws_trust` (Boolean) Specify whether to generate the appropriate security token response for a valid WS-Trust SecurityContextToken request.
- `pp_ws_trust_header` (Boolean) Specify whether to return the WS-Trust token as a SOAP header. By default, the token is put in the SOAP body. When enabled, return the token as a SOAP header by wrapping the <tt>wst:RequestedSecurityToken</tt> by a <tt>wst:IssuedToken</tt> .
- `pp_ws_trust_never_expire` (Boolean) Specify whether the WS-Trust security context expires. By default, the security context expires. When enabled, the security context never expires.However, you can change the duration afterward with an explicit duration in seconds before expiry.
- `pp_ws_trust_new_instance` (Boolean) Specify whether the STS renewal request issues a new instance for WS-Trust renewal. By default, the STS renewal request renews the existing instance. When enabled, the STS renewal request creates a new instance.
- `pp_ws_trust_new_key` (Boolean) Specify whether to update the context key for WS-Trust renewal.By default, the SCT renewal request uses the existing shared secret key. When enabled, the SCT renewal request does not use the existing shared secret key.
- `pp_ws_trust_renewal_wait` (Number) Specify the duration to allow the STS to keep an expired SecurityContext token in seconds. After a WS-Trust token expires, it can be removed from the STS and cannot be renewed. Therefore, the token must be renewed before expiry. Enter a value in the range of 0 - 2678400. The default value is 0. <p>The token is issued or renewed with a 1-hour wait time in the following situation.</p><ul><li>The WS-Trust request asks that the issued token can be renewed after expiration.</li><li>This setting has a value of 0.</li></ul>
- `pp_ws_username_token` (Boolean) Specify whether to add a WS-Security UsernameToken. The username and password are taken from the output of the map credentials phase.
- `pp_ws_username_token_allow_replacement` (Boolean) Specify whether to retain the original token, not generate a new one, if the message already contains a UsernameToken. By default, the original otken is retained. When enabled, the generated token replaces any existing ones.
- `pp_ws_username_token_include_pwd` (Boolean) Specify whether the WS-Security UsernameToken must include the password. By default, the token must contain the password.
- `pp_ws_username_token_password_type` (String) Specify the type of password that the UsernameToken provides. By default, use the digest of the password as defined in the "Web Services Security UsernameToken Profile 1.0" specification.
- `ppicrx_token` (Boolean) Specify whether to generate an Extended Identity Context Reference (ICRX) for z/OS identity propagation from the authenticated credentials. When generated, the WS-Security binary token with an ICRX token is inserted into the WS-Security header. You can use this token interoperability with the CICS Transaction Server for z/OS identity propagation support.
- `ppicrx_user_realm` (String) Specify the realm of a user for ICRX identity propagation. The ICRX realm is defined in the SAF configuration. Generally, this value is the equivalent of the prefix for a DN in a user registry.
