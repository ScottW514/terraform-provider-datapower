# datapower_style_policy_rule (Data Source)

Create, edit, or delete processing policy rules. Rules can also be created and edited using a drag and drop interface by opening the Services menu area on the left-hand navigation bar. Click the appropriate Policy link which will then present an opportunity to create both Rules and Actions.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "datapower_style_policy_rule" "test" {
  app_domain = "acceptance_test"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `app_domain` (String) The name of the application domain the object belongs to

### Read-Only

- `result` (Attributes List) List of objects (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result))

<a id="nestedatt--result"></a>
### Nested Schema for `result`

Optional:

- `dependency_actions` (Attributes List) Actions to take on other resources when operations are performed on this resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--dependency_actions))

Read-Only:

- `actions` (List of String) Define XSL filters and/or transformations. Select the desired existing action from the list and click Add to add the action to the rule. Actions are executed in the order (top to bottom) in which they are listed in the box. Click the + button to create a new Action; select an action and click the ... button to edit an existing action. To delete an action, select it from the list and click Delete.
- `app_domain` (String) The name of the application domain the object belongs to
- `direction` (String) Select a rule type. The default is Rule.
- `id` (String) Name of the object. Must be unique among object types in application domain.
- `input_format` (String) Select a decompression algorithm to apply to all messages before any other processing occurs (a preprocess step). All messages are decompressed using the selected algorithm. If the message is not compressed with this algorithm, an error is raised. This setting is independent of transport-level decompression. The default is None.
- `non_xml_processing` (Boolean) Normally, processing is only performed on XML content. This option allows processing actions to be performed on Non-XML content as well.
- `output_format` (String) Select a compression algorithm to apply to all messages after any other processing occurs (a post-process step). All messages are compressed using the selected algorithm. The resulting archive contains only one file. This setting is independent of transport-level compression. The default is None.
- `unprocessed` (Boolean) Permit rule to pass-through data unprocessed
- `user_summary` (String) Comments

### Nested Schema for `result.dependency_actions`

Required:

- `action` (String) Action to take on target resource
- `target_domain` (String) Application domain of the target for the action
- `target_type` (String) Resource type of the target for the action

Optional:

- `on_create` (Boolean) Execute this action on the target when creating this resource.
- `on_delete` (Boolean) Execute this action on the target when deleting this resource.
- `on_update` (Boolean) Execute this action on the target when updating this resource.
- `target_id` (String) Id of the target for the action (required for all resources except `datapower_domain`)
