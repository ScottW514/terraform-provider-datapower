## Schema

### Required

- `app_domain` (String) The name of the application domain the object belongs to

### Read-Only

- `result` (Attributes List) List of objects (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result))

### Nested Schema for `result`

Optional:

- `dependency_actions` (Attributes List) Actions to take on other resources when operations are performed on this resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--dependency_actions))

Read-Only:

- `acl` (String) This Access Control List will be used to allow or deny access to this service based on the IP address of the client. When attached to a service, an Access Control List (ACL) denies all access by default. To deny access to only selected addresses, first grant access to all addresses (allow 0.0.0.0) and then create deny entries for the desired hosts.
- `app_domain` (String) The name of the application domain the object belongs to
- `id` (String) Name of the object. Must be unique among object types in application domain.
- `local_address` (String) The address on which the service listens. The default of 0.0.0.0 indicates that the service is active on all addresses. Click Select Alias to use an alias for this value. Local host aliases help to ease migration tasks between machines. See Local Host Alias under Networking for more.
- `local_port` (Number) An integer (within the range 1 through 65535, with a default of 4000) that specifies the port monitored by the service.
- `persistent_connections` (Boolean) Enable or disable persistent connections where appropriate the front end.
