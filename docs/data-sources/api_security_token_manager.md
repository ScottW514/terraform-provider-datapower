# datapower_api_security_token_manager (Data Source)

<p>The API security token manager provides the storage configuration for security objects, which include OAuth providers and user security. Each domain has the <tt>default</tt> API security token manager. This instance is used by the domain to store and manage API details.</p><p>The API security token service uses gateway-peering instances for the internal and external token stores.</p>

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "datapower_api_security_token_manager" "test" {
  app_domain = "acceptance_test"
}
```
