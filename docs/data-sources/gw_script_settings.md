## Schema

### Read-Only

- `enabled` (Boolean) <p>The administrative state of the configuration.</p><ul><li>To make active, set to enabled.</li><li>To make inactive, set to disabled.</li></ul>
- `frozen_enabled` (Boolean) Specify whether to freeze the GatewayScript built-in object prototypes. <ul><li>When frozen, you cannot modify, add, or remove prototypes. This setting is the default setting.</li><li>When not frozen, you can manipulate prototypes.</li></ul><p>If you change and persist this property, the change is pending and requires a firmware reload.</p>
- `reload_needed` (Boolean) System reload needed
- `terminate_time` (Number) Specify the maximum duration in seconds that a GatewayScript action can continuously use CPU without yielding back to the system event loop. When the processing of a GatewayScript action exceeds the duration, processing is stopped and an error is logged. Enter a value in the range 1 - 300. The default value is 0, which indicates unlimited.
- `untrusted_code_mitigated` (Boolean) Specify whether to enable untrusted code mitigation to protect against Speculative Side-Channel Attacks (SSCA). <ul><li>When enabled, protects untrusted code against SSCA. This setting is the default setting.</li><li>When disabled, does not protect untrusted code against SSCA.</li></ul><p>If you change and persist this property, the change is pending and requires a firmware reload.</p>
- `user_summary` (String) Comments
