# datapower_smtp_server_connection (Data Source)

<p>The SMTP server connection defines the connection details for a Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) server. The DataPower Gateway uses the SMTP server connection for the following purposes</p><ul><li>B2B partners use this configuration to send an e-mail message to an AS1 or ESMTP destination.</li><li>B2B gateways use this configuration to request an AS1 MDN.</li></ul><p>For ease of configuration, the DataPower Gateway provides the <tt>default</tt> SMTP server connection configuration in each domain. By default, this configuration is empty and disabled.</p>

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "datapower_smtp_server_connection" "test" {
  id         = "AccTest_SMTPServerConnection"
  app_domain = "acceptance_test"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `app_domain` (String) The name of the application domain the object belongs to.

### Optional

- `id` (String) The name of the object to retrieve.

### Read-Only

- `result` (Attributes List) List of objects. If `id` was provided and it exists, it will be the only item in the list. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result))

### Nested Schema for `result`

Optional:

- `dependency_actions` (Attributes List) Actions to take on other resources when operations are performed on this resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--dependency_actions))

Read-Only:

- `account_name` (String) The account or user name of the SMTP client to authenticate on the SMTP server. The account generally takes the <tt>name@domain.com</tt> form. If blank, the configuration uses the setting from the basic authentication policy in the associated user agent.
- `account_password_alias` (String) The password alias of the password for the SMTP client account or the user name that is authenticated to the SMTP server. If password or alias are blank, the configuration uses the setting from the basic authentication policy in the associated user agent.
- `app_domain` (String) The name of the application domain the object belongs to
- `auth` (String) With the client authentication option, the method to authenticate the SMTP client. If blank, the configuration uses the setting from the SMTP client policy in the associated user agent.
- `id` (String) Name of the object. Must be unique among object types in application domain.
- `mail_server_host` (String) The IP address or host name of the SMTP server to send outgoing e-mail messages.
- `mail_server_port` (Number) The listening port on the SMTP server to send outgoing e-mail messages.
- `options` (Attributes) The SMTP options to enable for the SMTP client. If blank, the configuration uses the setting from the SMTP client policy in the associated user agent.
  - CLI Alias: `options` (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--options))
- `ssl_client` (String) The TLS client profile to secure connections between the DataPower Gateway and its targets.
- `ssl_client_config_type` (String) The TLS profile type to secure connections between the DataPower Gateway and its targets.
- `user_summary` (String) Comments

- `target_type` (String) Resource type of the target for the action

Optional:

- `on_create` (Boolean) Execute this action on the target when creating this resource.
- `on_delete` (Boolean) Execute this action on the target when deleting this resource.
- `on_update` (Boolean) Execute this action on the target when updating this resource.
- `target_id` (String) Id of the target for the action (required for all resources except `datapower_domain`)
