  An API key security definition defines the credentials that an API client must provide to the API gateway to identify itself when calling the API operations. You can require that the client must provide only the client ID, or both the client ID and client secret. When you require the client to provide both the client ID and client secret, you must define two separate configurations, one of type ID and the other of type secret.

# datapower_api_security_api_key (Data Source)

An API key security definition defines the credentials that an API client must provide to the API gateway to identify itself when calling the API operations. You can require that the client must provide only the client ID, or both the client ID and client secret. When you require the client to provide both the client ID and client secret, you must define two separate configurations, one of type ID and the other of type secret.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "datapower_api_security_api_key" "test" {
  id         = "AccTest_APISecurityAPIKey"
  app_domain = "acceptance_test"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `app_domain` (String) The name of the application domain the object belongs to.

### Optional

- `id` (String) The name of the object to retrieve.

### Read-Only

- `result` (Attributes List) List of objects. If `id` was provided and it exists, it will be the only item in the list. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result))

<a id="nestedatt--result"></a>
### Nested Schema for `result`

Read-Only:

- `app_domain` (String) The name of the application domain the object belongs to
- `id` (String) Name of the object. Must be unique among object types in application domain.
- `key_name` (String) Key name
- `type` (String) Type
- `user_summary` (String) Comments
- `where` (String) Specify the location of the client credentials. An API call fails if the credentials are not included in the specified location. <b>Note:</b> Regardless of where the client credentials are sent, you must specify the same location for the client ID and client secret.
