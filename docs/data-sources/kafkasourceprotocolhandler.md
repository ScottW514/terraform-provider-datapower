### Nested Schema for `result`

Optional:

Read-Only:

- `app_domain` (String) The name of the application domain the object belongs to
- `batch_size` (Number) Specify the number of messages to retrieve and process as a batch. The handler attempts to retrieve the number of specified messages from the consumer and processes these messages as a batch. Enter a value in the range 1 - 65535. The default value is 1.
