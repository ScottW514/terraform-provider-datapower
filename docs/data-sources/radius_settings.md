# datapower_radius_settings (Data Source)

RADIUS settings define RADIUS servers. You can use RADIUS servers to authenticate access with RBM or in a AAA policy. The DataPower Gateway is a client to RADIUS servers.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "datapower_radius_settings" "test" {
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `dependency_actions` (Attributes List) Actions to take on other resources when operations are performed on this resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--dependency_actions))

### Read-Only

- `aaa_servers` (Attributes List) AAA and RBM (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--aaa_servers))
- `enabled` (Boolean) <p>The administrative state of the configuration.</p><ul><li>To make active, set to enabled.</li><li>To make inactive, set to disabled.</li></ul>
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `retries` (Number) Specify the maximum number of times that the RADIUS client can retransmit an unacknowledged request to a server. Enter a value in the range 1 - 10. The default value is 3.
- `timeout` (Number) Specify the RADIUS retransmit interval in milliseconds. This timeout is the duration that the RADIUS client waits before an unacknowledged request is retransmitted. Enter a value in the range of 1 - 30000. The default value is 1000.
- `user_summary` (String) Comments

- `on_delete` (Boolean) Execute this action on the target when deleting this resource.
- `on_update` (Boolean) Execute this action on the target when updating this resource.

### Nested Schema for `aaa_servers`

Read-Only:

- `host` (String) Specify the IP address of the RADIUS server.
- `number` (Number) Specify the list position of this RADIUS server within the list of all RADIUS servers known to the client implementation. The lower the number, the more preferred the server.
