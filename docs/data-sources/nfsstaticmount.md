# datapower_nfsstaticmount (Data Source)

Create static NFS mounts for URL or file system access. These mounts remain mounted as long as their application domain is up.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "datapower_nfsstaticmount" "test" {
  app_domain = "acceptance_test"
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `app_domain` (String) The name of the application domain the object belongs to

### Read-Only

- `result` (Attributes List) List of objects (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result))

<a id="nestedatt--result"></a>
### Nested Schema for `result`

Optional:

- `dependency_actions` (Attributes List) Actions to take on other resources when operations are performed on this resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--dependency_actions))

Read-Only:

- `app_domain` (String) The name of the application domain the object belongs to
- `id` (String) Name of the object. Must be unique among object types in application domain.
- `local_filesystem_access` (Boolean) Specify whether to allow local file system access through the <tt>nfs-&lt;name></tt> directory. By default, local access is not enabled. When enabled, the NFS mount is available for file system access through the CLI in the <tt>nfs-&lt;name></tt> directory, where <tt>&lt;name></tt> is the name of the mount.
- `mount_type` (String) Specify the type of NFS mount. The default mount type is a hard mount.
- `read_only` (Boolean) Specify whether the mount is read-only. By default, the mount is not read-only.
- `read_size` (Number) Specify the size in bytes for NFS read operations. Enter a value in the range 1024 - 32768. The default value is 4096.
- `remote` (String) Specify the remote NFS file system to mount. Use the form <tt>host:/path</tt> , where <tt>host</tt> is the DNS name or IP address of the NFS server, and <tt>path</tt> is the path exported by the host to mount.
- `retransmissions` (Number) Specify the number of minor RPC timeouts and retransmissions until a major timeout. Enter a value in the range 1 - 60. The default value is 3.
- `timeout` (Number) Specify the time in tenths of seconds until the first retransmission on RPC times out. Enter a value in the range 1 - 600. The default value is 7.
- `transport` (String) Specify the transport protocol. The default transport protocol is TCP.
- `user_summary` (String) Comments
- `version` (Number) Specify the preferred NFS protocol version. Enter a value in the range 2 - 4. The default value is 3. <ul><li>If version 3 and the server only implements version 2, the client falls back to version 2.</li><li>If version 4, the remote export paths are different and prevents fallback.</li></ul>
- `write_size` (Number) Specify the size in bytes for NFS write operations. Enter a value in the range 1024 - 32768. The default value is 4096.

### Nested Schema for `result.dependency_actions`

Required:

- `action` (String) Action to take on target resource
- `target_domain` (String) Application domain of the target for the action
- `target_type` (String) Resource type of the target for the action

Optional:

- `on_create` (Boolean) Execute this action on the target when creating this resource.
- `on_delete` (Boolean) Execute this action on the target when deleting this resource.
- `on_update` (Boolean) Execute this action on the target when updating this resource.
- `target_id` (String) Id of the target for the action (required for all resources except `datapower_domain`)
