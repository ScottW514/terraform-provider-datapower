  An access control list (ACL) consists of a sequence of allow and deny clauses. Each clause identifies an IP address or range of addresses that grants or denies access to a service.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "datapower_access_control_list" "test" {
  id         = "AccTest_AccessControlList"
  app_domain = "acceptance_test"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `app_domain` (String) The name of the application domain the object belongs to.

### Optional

- `id` (String) The name of the object to retrieve.

### Read-Only

- `result` (Attributes List) List of objects. If `id` was provided and it exists, it will be the only item in the list. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result))

<a id="nestedatt--result"></a>
### Nested Schema for `result`

Read-Only:

- `access_control_entry` (Attributes List) Specify allow and deny clauses. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--access_control_entry))
- `app_domain` (String) The name of the application domain the object belongs to
- `id` (String) Name of the object. Must be unique among object types in application domain.

<a id="nestedatt--result--access_control_entry"></a>
### Nested Schema for `result.access_control_entry`

Read-Only:

- `access` (String) Specify whether to allow or deny access. <ul><li>When allow, the range of address is granted access to the service.</li><li>When deny, the range of addresses is denied access to the service.</li></ul>
- `address` (String) Specify the contiguous range of IP addresses that are granted or denied access. Enter the value as an IP address and network mask.
