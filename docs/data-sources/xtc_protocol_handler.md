# datapower_xtc_protocol_handler (Data Source)

The configuration for the stateful TCP protocol handler. This protocol uses raw XML - where the close of the root node delineates the document - PI and comments outside of the root node are not allowed. The source protocol also specifies the destination address and any single TCP connection will use the same TCP session on the backside for all of its transactions (one transaction per document). <p>Any gateway that employs one of these handlers must use a dynamic backend.</p>

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "datapower_xtc_protocol_handler" "test" {
  app_domain = "acceptance_test"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `app_domain` (String) The name of the application domain the object belongs to

### Read-Only

- `result` (Attributes List) List of objects (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result))

<a id="nestedatt--result"></a>
### Nested Schema for `result`

Optional:

- `dependency_actions` (Attributes List) Actions to take on other resources when operations are performed on this resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--dependency_actions))

Read-Only:

- `acl` (String) Access control list
- `app_domain` (String) The name of the application domain the object belongs to
- `close_on_fault` (Boolean) Specify whether to close the session on fault. When enabled, TCP connections between clients and servers are closed when the system generates a fault. Otherwise, the session is closed at only connection termination, timeout, or error.
- `id` (String) Name of the object. Must be unique among object types in application domain.
- `local_address` (String) Specify the local IP address that the service listens. The default value is 0.0.0.0, which indicates that the service is active on all addresses. You can use a local host alias to help ease migration.
- `local_port` (Number) Specifies the port that this service monitors. Enter a value in the range 1 - 65535. The default value is 3000.
- `remote_address` (String) Remote host
- `remote_port` (Number) Remote port
- `ssl_client` (String) TLS client profile
- `ssl_config_type` (String) TLS type
- `ssl_server` (String) TLS server profile
- `ssl_sni_server` (String) TLS SNI server profile
- `user_summary` (String) Comments

### Nested Schema for `result.dependency_actions`

Required:

- `action` (String) Action to take on target resource
- `target_domain` (String) Application domain of the target for the action
- `target_type` (String) Resource type of the target for the action

Optional:

- `on_create` (Boolean) Execute this action on the target when creating this resource.
- `on_delete` (Boolean) Execute this action on the target when deleting this resource.
- `on_update` (Boolean) Execute this action on the target when updating this resource.
- `target_id` (String) Id of the target for the action (required for all resources except `datapower_domain`)
